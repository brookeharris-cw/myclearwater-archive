            <div>(1) The Chief Financial Officer is designated as “State Fire Marshal.” The State Fire Marshal has authority to adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 to implement this chapter. Rules must be in substantial conformity with generally accepted standards of fire safety; must take into consideration the direct supervision of children in non-residential child care facilities; and must balance and temper the need of the State Fire Marshal to protect all Floridians from fire hazards with the social and economic inconveniences that may be caused or created by the rules. The department shall adopt the Florida Fire Prevention Code.</div>

            <div>(4) It is the intent of the Legislature that the rules promulgated by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to this section be enforced in such a manner as to prohibit the displacement of currently placed mobile homes unless there is a threat of imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public.</div>
            <div>(5) It is the intent of the Legislature that there are to be no conflicting requirements between the Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Florida Building Code or conflicts in their enforcement and interpretation. Potential conflicts shall be resolved through coordination and cooperation of the State Fire Marshal and the Florida Building Commission as provided by this chapter and part IV of chapter 553.</div>
            <div>(6) Only the State Fire Marshal may issue, and, when requested in writing by any substantially affected person or a local enforcing agency, the State Fire Marshal shall issue declaratory statements pursuant to s. 120.565 relating to the Florida Fire Prevention Code.</div>
            <div>(7) The State Fire Marshal, in consultation with the Department of Education, shall adopt and administer rules prescribing standards for the safety and health of occupants of educational and ancillary facilities pursuant to ss. 633.206, 1013.12, 1013.37, and 1013.371.

            <div>633.106 State Fire Marshal; disciplinary authority; administrative fine and probation in lieu of suspension, revocation, or refusal to issue a license, permit, or certificate.—
            <div>(1) The State Fire Marshal may deny, suspend, or revoke the license, certificate, or permit of any individual who does not meet the qualifications established by, or who violates any provision under, this chapter or any rule authorized by this chapter.</div>
            <div>(2) If the State Fire Marshal finds that one or more grounds exist for the suspension, revocation, or refusal to issue, renew, or continue any license, certificate, or permit issued under this chapter, the State Fire Marshal may, in its discretion, in lieu of the suspension, revocation, or refusal to issue, renew, or continue, and, except on a second offense or when the suspension, revocation, or refusal to issue, renew, or continue is mandatory, impose upon the licensee, certificate holder, or permittee one or more of the following:
            <div>(a) An administrative fine not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, and not to exceed a total of $10,000 in any one proceeding.</div>
            <div>(b) Probation for a period not to exceed 2 years, as specified by the State Fire Marshal in her or his order.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) The State Fire Marshal may allow the licensee, certificate holder, or permittee a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 days, within which to pay to the State Fire Marshal the amount of the fine. If the licensee, certificate holder, or permittee fails to pay the administrative fine in its entirety to the State Fire Marshal within such period, the license, permit, or certificate shall stand suspended until payment of the administrative fine.</div>
            <div>(4) As a condition to probation or in connection therewith, the State Fire Marshal may specify in her or his order reasonable terms and conditions to be fulfilled by the probationer during the probation period. If during the probation period the State Fire Marshal has good cause to believe that the probationer has violated any of the terms and conditions, she or he shall suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue, renew, or continue the license, certificate, or permit of the probationer, as upon the original ground or grounds referred to in subsection (2).</div>

            <div>633.107 Exemption from disqualification from licensure or certification.—
            <div>(1) The department may grant an exemption from disqualification to any person disqualified from licensure or certification by the Division of State Fire Marshal under this chapter because of a criminal record or dishonorable discharge from the United States Armed Forces if the applicant has paid in full any fee, fine, fund, lien, civil judgment, restitution, cost of prosecution, or trust contribution imposed by the court as part of the judgment and sentence for any disqualifying offense and:
            <div>(a) At least 5 years have elapsed since the applicant completed or has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or nonmonetary condition imposed by the court for a disqualifying offense; or</div>
            <div>(b) At least 5 years have elapsed since the applicant was dishonorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) For the department to grant an exemption, the applicant must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that he or she would not pose a risk to persons or property if permitted to be licensed or certified under this chapter, evidence of which must include, but need not be limited to, facts and circumstances surrounding the disqualifying offense, the time that has elapsed since the offense, the nature of the offense and harm caused to the victim, the applicant’s history before and after the offense, and any other evidence or circumstances indicating that the applicant will not present a danger if permitted to be licensed or certified.</div>
            <div>(3) The department has discretion whether to grant or deny an exemption. The department shall provide its decision in writing which, if the exemption is denied, must state with particularity the reasons for denial. The department’s decision is subject to proceedings under chapter 120, except that a formal proceeding under s. 120.57(1) is available only if there are disputed issues of material fact that the department relied upon in reaching its decision.</div>
            <div>(4) An applicant may request an exemption, notwithstanding the time limitations of paragraphs (1)(a) and (b), if by executive clemency his or her civil rights are restored, or he or she receives a pardon, from the disqualifying offense. The fact that the applicant receives executive clemency does not alleviate his or her obligation to comply with subsection (2) or in itself require the department to award the exemption.</div>
            <div>(5) The division may adopt rules to administer this section.</div>

            <div>633.108 State Fire Marshal; chapter and rules; force and effect.—This chapter and all rules promulgated by the State Fire Marshal hereunder shall have the same force and effect in each municipality, county, and special district having fire safety responsibilities as the ordinances of each municipality, county, and special district having fire safety responsibilities and shall be enforceable in the courts in the same manner as such ordinances.
            <div>History.—s. 1, ch. 21847, 1943; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 70-299; s. 1, ch. 77-119; s. 10, ch. 87-287; s. 5, ch. 2013-183.</div>

            </div>
            <div>633.112 State Fire Marshal; hearings; investigations; recordkeeping and reports; subpoenas of witnesses; orders of circuit court.—
            <div>(1) The State Fire Marshal may in his or her discretion take or cause to be taken the testimony on oath of a person whom he or she believes to be cognizant of any facts in relation to matters under investigation.</div>
            <div>(2) If the State Fire Marshal is of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence to charge a person with an offense, he or she must cause the arrest of such person and must furnish to the prosecuting officer of any court having jurisdiction of the offense all information obtained by him or her, including a copy of all pertinent and material testimony taken, together with the names and addresses of all witnesses. In the conduct of such investigations, the State Fire Marshal may request such assistance as may reasonably be given by such prosecuting officers and other local officials.</div>
            <div>(3) The State Fire Marshal may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses before him or her to testify in relation to any matter which is, by this chapter, a subject of inquiry and investigation, and he or she may require the production of any book, paper, or document deemed pertinent thereto by him or her, and may seize furniture and other personal property to be held for evidence.</div>
            <div>(4) A person so summoned and so testifying shall be entitled to the same witness fees and mileage as provided for witnesses testifying in the circuit courts of this state, and officers serving subpoenas or orders of the State Fire Marshal shall be paid in like manner for like services in such courts, from the funds herein provided.</div>
            <div>(5) Any agent designated by the State Fire Marshal for such purposes may hold hearings, sign and issue subpoenas, administer oaths, examine witnesses, receive evidence, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such accounts, records, memoranda, or other evidence, as may be material for the determination of any complaint or conducting any inquiry or investigation under this chapter. In the case of disobedience to a subpoena, the State Fire Marshal or her or his agent may invoke the aid of any court of competent jurisdiction in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of accounts, records, memoranda, or other evidence and any such court may in case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to a person, issue an order requiring the person to appear before the State Fire Marshal’s agent or produce accounts, records, memoranda, or other evidence, as so ordered, or to give evidence touching any matter pertinent to any complaint or the subject of any inquiry or investigation, and any failure to obey such order of the court shall be punished by the court as contempt.</div>
            <div>(6) Upon request, the State Fire Marshal shall investigate the cause, origin, and circumstances of fires and explosions occurring in this state wherein property has been damaged or destroyed and there is probable cause to believe that the fire or explosion was the result of carelessness or design.
            <div>(a) Any time a fire or explosion has occurred which results in property damage or destruction in any municipality, county, or special district having an organized fire department, any local fire official whose intent is to request the State Fire Marshal to perform an investigation shall make or shall cause to be made an initial investigation of the circumstances surrounding the cause and origin of the fire or explosion. Law enforcement officers may conduct such initial investigations.</div>
            <div>(b) If the fire or explosion occurs in a municipality, county, or special district that does not have an organized fire department or designated arson investigations unit within its law enforcement providers, the municipality, county, or special district may request the State Fire Marshal to conduct the initial investigation.</div>
            <div>(c) The State Fire Marshal shall adopt rules to assist local fire officials and law enforcement officers in determining the established responsibilities with respect to the initial or preliminary assessment of fire and explosion scenes, and the determination of whether probable cause exists to refer such scenes to the State Fire Marshal for an investigation.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(7) The State Fire Marshal shall keep a record of all fires and explosions occurring in this state upon which she or he had caused an investigation to be made and all facts concerning the same. These records, obtained or prepared by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to her or his investigation, include documents, papers, letters, maps, diagrams, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, and evidence. These records are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) until the investigation is completed or ceases to be active. For purposes of this section, an investigation is considered “active” while such investigation is being conducted by the department with a reasonable, good-faith belief that it may lead to the filing of administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings. An investigation does not cease to be active if the department is proceeding with reasonable dispatch, and there is a good faith belief that action may be initiated by the department or other administrative or law enforcement agency. Further, these documents, papers, letters, maps, diagrams, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, and evidence relative to the subject of an investigation shall not be subject to subpoena until the investigation is completed or ceases to be active, unless the State Fire Marshal consents. These records shall be made daily from the reports furnished the State Fire Marshal by her or his agents or others.</div>
            <div>(8) Whenever the State Fire Marshal releases an investigative report, any person requesting a copy of the report shall pay in advance, and the State Fire Marshal shall collect in advance, notwithstanding the provisions of s. 624.501(19)(a) and (b), a fee of $10 for the copy of the report, which fee shall be deposited into the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund. The State Fire Marshal may release the report without charge to any state attorney or to any law enforcement agency or fire department assisting in the investigation.</div>

            <div>633.126 Investigation of fraudulent insurance claims and crimes; immunity of insurance companies supplying information.—
            <div>
            <div>(1)(a) As used in this section, the term “consultant” means any individual or entity, or employee of the individual or entity, retained by an insurer to assist in the investigation of a fire, explosion, or suspected fraudulent insurance act.</div>
            <div>(b) The State Fire Marshal or an agent appointed pursuant to s. 633.114, an agent of the Division of Investigative and Forensic Services, any law enforcement officer as defined in s. 111.065, any law enforcement officer of a federal agency, or any fire service provider official who is engaged in the investigation of a fire or explosion loss may request any insurance company or its agent, adjuster, employee, or attorney, investigating a claim under an insurance policy or contract with respect to a fire or explosion to release any information whatsoever in the possession of the insurance company or its agent, adjuster, employee, or attorney relative to a loss from that fire or explosion. The insurance company shall release the available information to and cooperate with any official authorized to request such information pursuant to this section. The information shall include, but shall not be limited to:
            <div>1. Any insurance policy relevant to a loss under investigation and any application for such a policy.</div>
            <div>2. Any policy premium payment records.</div>
            <div>3. The records, reports, and all material pertaining to any previous claims made by the insured with the reporting company.</div>
            <div>4. Material relating to the investigation of the loss, including statements of a person, proof of loss, and other relevant evidence.</div>
            <div>5. Memoranda, notes, and correspondence relating to the investigation of the loss in the possession of the insurance company or its agents, adjusters, employees, or attorneys.</div>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) If an insurance company has reason to suspect that a fire or explosion loss to its insured’s real or personal property was caused by intentional means, the company shall notify the State Fire Marshal and shall furnish her or him with all material acquired by the company during its investigation. The State Fire Marshal may adopt rules to implement this subsection.</div>
            <div>(3) In the absence of fraud, bad faith, or malice, a representative of or consultant to an insurance company or of the National Insurance Crime Bureau employed to adjust or investigate losses caused by fire or explosion is not liable for damages in a civil action for furnishing information concerning fires or explosions suspected to be other than accidental to investigators employed by other insurance companies or the National Insurance Crime Bureau.</div>
            <div>(4) No insurance company or person who furnishes information on its behalf shall be liable for damages in a civil action or subject to criminal prosecution for any oral or written statement made or any other action taken that is necessary and required by the provisions of this section.</div>
            <div>(5) At such time as the release of the investigative records is required by law, the official or agency in possession of such records shall provide written notice to the insurance company providing the information and to all parties, at least 10 days prior to releasing such records. Official, departmental, or agency personnel may discuss such matters with other official, departmental, or agency personnel, and any insurance company complying with this section, and may share such information, if such discussion is necessary to enable the orderly and efficient conduct of the investigation. These discussions are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 286.011.</div>
            <div>(6) The actions of an insurance company or of its agents, employees, adjusters, consultants, or attorneys, in complying with the statutory obligation of this section may not be construed by a court as a waiver or abandonment of any privilege or confidentiality of attorney work product, attorney-client communication, or such other privilege or immunity as is provided by law.</div>
            <div>(7) Any official described in subsection (1) may be required to testify as to any information in her or his possession regarding an insurance loss in any civil action in which any person seeks recovery under a policy against an insurance company for an insurance loss, subject to the provisions of subsection (6).</div>
            <div>(8) No person may intentionally refuse to release any information requested pursuant to this section.</div>
            <div>(9) A person who willfully violates this section commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.</div>

            <div>633.142 Reduced Cigarette Ignition Propensity Standard and Firefighter Protection Act; preemption.—
            <div>(1) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the “Reduced Cigarette Ignition Propensity Standard and Firefighter Protection Act.”</div>
            <div>(2) LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.—The Legislature finds and declares that:
            <div>(a) Cigarettes are the leading cause of fire deaths in this state and in the nation.</div>
            <div>(b) Each year in the United States, between 700 and 900 persons are killed and around 3,000 persons are injured in fires ignited by cigarettes, while in this state 153 residential fires and 5 fatalities were attributable to fires caused by cigarettes in 2006.</div>
            <div>(c) A high percentage of the victims of cigarette fires are nonsmokers, including senior citizens and young children.</div>
            <div>(d) Fires caused by cigarettes result in billions of dollars in property losses and damages in the United States and millions of dollars in property losses and damages in this state.</div>
            <div>(e) Cigarette fires unnecessarily jeopardize the safety of firefighters and result in avoidable emergency response costs for municipalities.</div>
            <div>(f) In 2004, the State of New York implemented a cigarette fire safety regulation requiring cigarettes sold in that state to meet a fire safety performance standard; in 2005, Vermont and California enacted cigarette fire safety laws directly incorporating New York’s regulation into statute; and in 2006, Illinois, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts joined these states in enacting similar laws.</div>
            <div>(g) In 2005, Canada implemented the New York State fire safety standard, becoming the first country to have a nationwide cigarette fire safety standard.</div>
            <div>(h) New York State’s cigarette fire safety standard is based upon decades of research by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Congressional research groups, and private industry. This cigarette fire safety standard minimizes costs to the state; minimally burdens cigarette manufacturers, distributors, and retail sellers; and, therefore, should become law in this state.</div>
            <div>(i) It is therefore fitting and proper for this state to adopt the cigarette fire safety standard that is in effect in the State of New York to reduce the likelihood that cigarettes will cause fires and result in deaths, injuries, and property damages.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) DEFINITIONS.—For the purposes of this section:
            <div>(a) “Agent” means any person authorized by the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation to purchase and affix stamps on packages of cigarettes.</div>
            <div>(b) “Cigarette” means:

            <div>(4) TEST METHOD AND PERFORMANCE STANDARD.—
            <div>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f), no cigarettes may be sold or offered for sale in this state, or sold or offered for sale to persons located in this state, unless the cigarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and meet the performance standard specified in this subsection, a written certification has been filed by the manufacturer with the division in accordance with subsection (5), and the cigarettes have been marked in accordance with subsection (6).
            <div>1. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials standard E2187-04, “Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes.”</div>
            <div>2. Testing shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper.</div>
            <div>3. No more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial in accordance with this subsection shall exhibit full-length burns. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested.</div>
            <div>4. The performance standard required by this subsection shall only be applied to a complete test trial.</div>
            <div>5. Written certifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization or another comparable accreditation standard required by the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>6. Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this subsection shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.19.</div>
            <div>7. This subsection does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistently with this section for any other purpose.</div>
            <div>8. The State Fire Marshal may, in his or her discretion or upon the request of the division, perform or sponsor testing to determine a cigarette’s compliance with the required performance standard. Any such discretionary compliance testing by the State Fire Marshal shall be conducted in accordance with this subsection.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(b) Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to subsection (5) that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard set forth in this subsection shall have at least two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design, there shall be at least two bands fully located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column for non-filtered cigarettes.</div>
            <div>(c) A manufacturer of a cigarette that the State Fire Marshal determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in subparagraph (a)1. shall propose a test method and performance standard for the cigarette to the State Fire Marshal. Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the State Fire Marshal that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in subparagraph (a)3., the manufacturer may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to subsection (5). If the State Fire Marshal determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this section, and if the State Fire Marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that state’s law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this subsection, the State Fire Marshal shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in this state unless the State Fire Marshal demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under this section. All other applicable requirements of this subsection shall apply to the manufacturer.</div>
            <div>(d) Each manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for a period of 3 years and shall make copies of the reports available to the division, the State Fire Marshal, and the Attorney General upon written request. Any manufacturer who fails to make copies of the reports available within 60 days after receiving a written request shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day after the 60th day that the manufacturer does not make such copies available.</div>
            <div>(e) The State Fire Marshal may adopt a subsequent American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that such subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials Standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in subparagraph (a)3.</div>
            <div>(f) The requirements of paragraph (a) shall not prohibit:
            <div>1. Wholesale or retail dealers from selling their existing inventory of cigarettes on or after the effective date of this section if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes prior to the effective date and the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was purchased prior to the effective date in comparable quantity to the inventory purchased during the same period of the prior year; or</div>
            <div>2. The sale of cigarettes solely for the purpose of consumer testing. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “consumer testing” means an assessment of cigarettes that is conducted by or is under the control and direction of a manufacturer for the purpose of evaluating consumer acceptance of such cigarettes and that uses only the quantity of cigarettes that is reasonably necessary for such assessment.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(g) It is the intent of the Legislature by this section to promote uniformity among the states in the regulation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity. As a result, the resolution of issues regarding the interpretation and implementation of this section should be made in a manner consistent with the New York Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes, New York Executive Law, Section 156-C, as amended, and Part 429 of Title 19 New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations, as amended, and the interpretation and implementation thereof, as they exist on March 1, 2008.</div>

            <div>(e) If a manufacturer has certified a cigarette pursuant to this subsection and thereafter makes any change to such cigarette that is likely to alter its compliance with the reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards required by this section, that cigarette shall not be sold or offered for sale in this state until the manufacturer retests the cigarette in accordance with the testing standards set forth in subsection (4) and maintains records of that retesting as required by subsection (4). Any altered cigarette that does not meet the performance standard set forth in subsection (4) may not be sold in this state.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(6) MARKING OF CIGARETTE PACKAGING.—
            <div>(a) Cigarettes that are certified by a manufacturer in accordance with subsection (5) shall be marked to indicate compliance with the requirements of subsection (4). The marking shall be in 8-point type or larger and consist of:

            <div>(c) The division shall be notified as to the marking that is selected.</div>
            <div>(d) Prior to the certification of any cigarette, a manufacturer shall present its proposed marking to the division for approval. Upon receipt of the request, the division shall approve or disapprove the marking offered, except that the division shall approve:
            <div>1. Any marking in use and approved for sale in the State of New York pursuant to the New York Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes; or</div>
            <div>2. The letters “FSC,” which signify “Fire Standards Compliant,” appearing in 8-point type or larger and permanently printed, stamped, engraved, or embossed on the package at or near the universal product code.</div>
            <p justify"="">Proposed markings shall be deemed approved if the division fails to act within 10 business days after receiving a request for approval.</p>
            </div>
            <div>(e) No manufacturer shall modify its approved marking unless the modification has been approved by the division in accordance with this subsection.</div>
            <div>(f) Manufacturers certifying cigarettes in accordance with subsection (5) shall provide a copy of the certifications to all wholesale dealers and agents to which they sell cigarettes and shall also provide sufficient copies of an illustration of the package marking used by the manufacturer pursuant to this subsection for each retail dealer to which the wholesale dealers or agents sell cigarettes. Wholesale dealers and agents shall provide a copy of these package markings received from manufacturers to all retail dealers to which they sell cigarettes. Wholesale dealers, agents, and retail dealers shall permit the division, the State Fire Marshal, the Attorney General, and their employees to inspect markings of cigarette packaging marked in accordance with this subsection.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(7) PENALTIES.—
            <div>(a) A manufacturer, wholesale dealer, agent, or any other person or entity that knowingly sells or offers to sell cigarettes, other than through retail sale, in violation of subsection (4) shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100 for each pack of such cigarettes sold or offered for sale.

            </div>
            <div>633.202 Florida Fire Prevention Code.—
            <div>(1) The State Fire Marshal shall adopt, by rule pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54, the Florida Fire Prevention Code which shall contain or incorporate by reference all fire safety laws and rules that pertain to and govern the design, construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair, and demolition of public and private buildings, structures, and facilities and the enforcement of such fire safety laws and rules. The State Fire Marshal shall adopt a new edition of the Florida Fire Prevention Code every third year.</div>
            <div>(2) The State Fire Marshal shall adopt the current edition of the National Fire Protection Association’s Standard 1, Fire Prevention Code but may not adopt a building, mechanical, or plumbing code. The State Fire Marshal shall adopt the current edition of the Life Safety Code, NFPA 101, current editions, by reference. The State Fire Marshal may modify the selected codes and standards as needed to accommodate the specific needs of the state. Standards or criteria in the selected codes shall be similarly incorporated by reference. The State Fire Marshal shall incorporate within sections of the Florida Fire Prevention Code provisions that address uniform fire safety standards as established in s. 633.206. The State Fire Marshal shall incorporate within sections of the Florida Fire Prevention Code provisions addressing regional and local concerns and variations.</div>
            <div>(3) No later than 180 days before the triennial adoption of the Florida Fire Prevention Code, the State Fire Marshal shall notify each municipal, county, and special district fire department of the triennial code adoption and steps necessary for local amendments to be included within the code. No later than 120 days before the triennial adoption of the Florida Fire Prevention Code, each local jurisdiction shall provide the State Fire Marshal with copies of its local fire code amendments. The State Fire Marshal has the option to process local fire code amendments that are received less than 120 days before the adoption date of the Florida Fire Prevention Code.
            <div>(a) The State Fire Marshal shall review or cause the review of local amendments to determine:
            <div>1. If the local amendment should be adopted as a statewide provision;</div>
            <div>2. That the local amendment does not provide a lesser degree of life safety than the code otherwise provides; and</div>
            <div>3. That the local amendment does not reference a different edition of the national fire codes or other national standard than the edition provided or referenced in the uniform or minimum fire safety codes adopted by the State Fire Marshal or prescribed by statute.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(b) Any local amendment to the Florida Fire Prevention Code adopted by a local government shall be effective only until the adoption of the new edition of the Florida Fire Prevention Code, which shall be every third year. At such time, the State Fire Marshal shall adopt such amendment as part of the Florida Fire Prevention Code or rescind the amendment. The State Fire Marshal shall immediately notify the respective local government of the rescission of the amendment and the reason for the rescission. After receiving such notice, the respective local government may readopt the rescinded amendment. Incorporation of local amendments as regional and local concerns and variations shall be considered as adoption of an amendment pursuant to this section.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) The State Fire Marshal shall update, by rule adopted pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54, the Florida Fire Prevention Code every 3 years. Once initially adopted and subsequently updated, the Florida Fire Prevention Code shall be adopted for use statewide without adoptions by local governments. When updating the Florida Fire Prevention Code, the State Fire Marshal shall consider changes made by the national model fire codes incorporated into the Florida Fire Prevention Code, the State Fire Marshal’s own interpretations, declaratory statements, appellate decisions, and approved statewide and local technical amendments.</div>
            <div>(5) Upon the conclusion of a triennial update to the Florida Fire Prevention Code and notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the State Fire Marshal may address the issues identified in this subsection by amending the Florida Fire Prevention Code, subject only to the rule adoption procedures of chapter 120. Following the approval of any amendments to the Florida Fire Prevention Code by the State Fire Marshal and publication on the State Fire Marshal’s website, authorities having jurisdiction to enforce the Florida Fire Prevention Code may enforce the amendments to the code. The State Fire Marshal may approve only amendments that are needed to address:
            <div>(a) Conflicts within the updated Florida Fire Prevention Code;</div>
            <div>(b) Conflicts between the updated Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Florida Building Code adopted pursuant to chapter 553;</div>
            <div>(c) The omission of Florida-specific amendments that were previously adopted in the Florida Fire Prevention Code; or</div>
            <div>(d) Unintended results from the integration of Florida-specific amendments that were previously adopted with the model code.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(6) The Florida Fire Prevention Code does not apply to, and no code enforcement action shall be brought with respect to, zoning requirements or land use requirements. Additionally, a local code enforcement agency may not administer or enforce the Florida Fire Prevention Code to prevent the siting of any publicly owned facility, including, but not limited to, correctional facilities, juvenile justice facilities, or state universities, community colleges, or public education facilities. This section shall not be construed to prohibit local government from imposing built-in fire protection systems or fire-related infrastructure requirements needed to properly protect the intended facility.</div>
            <div>(7) Any local amendment adopted by a local government must strengthen the Fire Prevention Code requirements of the minimum fire safety code.</div>
            <div>(8) Within 30 days after a local government adopts a local amendment, the local government must transmit the amendment to the Florida Building Commission and the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(9) The State Fire Marshal shall make rules that implement this section and ss. 633.104 and 633.208 for the purpose of accomplishing the objectives set forth in those sections.</div>
            <div>(10) Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, if a county or a municipality within that county adopts an ordinance providing for a local amendment to the Florida Fire Prevention Code and that amendment provides a higher level of protection to the public than the level specified in the Florida Fire Prevention Code, the local amendment becomes effective without approval of the State Fire Marshal and is not rescinded pursuant to this section, provided that the ordinance meets one or more of the following criteria:
            <div>(a) The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a fire service facilities and operation plan that outlines goals and objectives for related equipment, personnel, and capital improvement needs of the local authority related to the specific amendment for the next 5 years;</div>
            <div>(b) The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a provision requiring proportionate reduction in, or rebate or waivers of, impact or other fees or assessments levied on buildings that are built or modified in compliance with the more stringent fire safety standards required by the local amendment; or</div>
            <div>(c) The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a growth management plan that requires buildings and structures to be equipped with more stringent fire safety requirements required by the local amendment when these fire safety requirements are used as the basis for planning infrastructure development, uses, or housing densities.</div>
            <p justify"="">Except as provided in s. 633.206, the local appeals process shall be the venue if there is a dispute between parties affected by the provisions of the more stringent local fire safety amendment adopted as part of the Florida Fire Prevention Code pursuant to the authority in this subsection. Local amendments adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed local or regional variations and published as such in the Florida Fire Prevention Code. The act of publishing locally adopted fire safety amendments to the Florida Fire Prevention Code may not be construed to mean that the State Fire Marshal approves or denies the authenticity or appropriateness of the locally adopted fire safety provision, and the burden of protecting the local fire safety amendment remains solely with the adopting local governmental authority.</p>

            </div>
            <div>633.206 Uniform fire safety standards—The Legislature hereby determines that to protect the public health, safety, and welfare it is necessary to provide for fire safety standards governing the construction and utilization of certain buildings and structures. The Legislature further determines that certain buildings or structures, due to their specialized use or to the special characteristics of the person utilizing or occupying these buildings or structures, should be subject to fire safety standards reflecting these special needs as may be appropriate.
            <div>(1) The department shall establish uniform fire safety standards that apply to:
            <div>(a) All new, existing, and proposed state-owned and state-leased buildings.</div>
            <div>(b) All new, existing, and proposed hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult family-care homes, correctional facilities, public schools, transient public lodging establishments, public food service establishments, elevators, migrant labor camps, mobile home parks, lodging parks, recreational vehicle parks, recreational camps, residential and non-residential child care facilities, facilities for the developmentally disabled, motion picture and television special effects productions, tunnels, and self-service gasoline stations, of which standards the State Fire Marshal is the final administrative interpreting authority.</div>
            <p justify"="">In the event there is a dispute between the owners of the buildings specified in paragraph (b) and a local authority requiring a more stringent uniform fire safety standard for sprinkler systems, the State Fire Marshal shall be the final administrative interpreting authority and the State Fire Marshal’s interpretation regarding the uniform fire safety standards shall be considered final agency action.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <div>(2)(a) With respect to the uniform fire safety standards, the department shall develop uniform statewide standards which are reasonably prudent with respect to protecting life, safety, and property and which take into consideration the characteristics of the people utilizing the subject buildings and structures and other hazards associated with the subject buildings and structures throughout the state.</div>
            <div>(b) A local authority may not require more stringent uniform fire safety standards with respect to buildings or structures subject to such standards except as provided in paragraph (c). A local authority may, on a case-by-case basis, in order to meet special situations arising from historic, geographic, or unusual conditions, with respect to a building or structure which is subject to the uniform fire safety standards, authorize equivalent alternative standards for such building or structure; however, the alternative requirements shall not result in a level of protection to life, safety, or property less stringent than the applicable uniform fire safety standards. All such local authorities shall enforce, within their fire safety jurisdiction, the uniform fire safety standards for those buildings specified in paragraph (1)(b) and the minimum fire safety standards adopted pursuant to s. 394.879.</div>
            <div>(c) A local authority may require more stringent uniform fire safety standards for sprinkler systems in buildings specified in paragraph (b), for which the construction contract is let after January 1, 1994, if the following conditions are met:
            <div>1. The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a fire service facilities and operation plan that outlines goals and objectives for related equipment, personnel, and capital improvement needs of the local authority for the next 5 years.</div>
            <div>2. The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a provision requiring proportionate reductions in, or rebate or waivers of, impact or other fees or assessments levied on buildings that are built or modified in compliance with the more stringent sprinkler standards.</div>
            <div>3. The local authority has adopted, by ordinance, a plan that requires buildings specified in paragraph (b) to be equipped with an automatic sprinkler system installed in compliance with the provisions prescribed in standards as established by the National Fire Protection Association and adopted by the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <p justify"="">In the event there is a dispute between the owners of the buildings specified in paragraph (b) and a local authority requiring a more stringent uniform fire safety standard for sprinkler systems, the State Fire Marshal shall be the final administrative interpreting authority and the State Fire Marshal’s interpretation regarding the uniform fire safety standards shall be considered final agency action.</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) In establishing the uniform fire safety standards and the minimum fire safety standards, as required by s. 394.879, the department shall consider types of construction materials and their flame spread and smoke characteristics, occupancy levels, means of egress, special hazard protection, smoke barriers, interior finish, and fire protection systems or equipment and occupancy features necessary to minimize danger to life from fire, smoke, fumes, or panic. In considering these factors, the department shall develop minimum standards which are reasonably prudent with respect to protecting life, safety, and property.</div>
            <div>
            <div>(4)(a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, each nursing home licensed under part II of chapter 400 shall be protected throughout by an approved, supervised automatic sprinkler system in accordance with s. 9 of National Fire Protection Association, Inc., Life Safety Code, no later than December 31, 2010.</div>
            <div>(b) The division may grant up to two 1-year extensions of the time limits for compliance in subparagraph (a)2. if the division determines that the nursing home has been prevented from complying for reasons beyond its control.</div>
            <div>(c) The division is authorized to adopt any rule necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this subsection. The division shall enforce this subsection in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and any nursing home licensed under part II of chapter 400 that is in violation of this subsection may be subject to administrative sanctions by the division pursuant to this chapter.</div>
            <div>(d) Adjustments shall be made to the provider Medicaid rate to allow reimbursement over a 5-year period for Medicaid’s portion of the costs incurred to meet the requirements of this subsection. Funding for this adjustment shall come from existing nursing home appropriations.</div>

            </div>
            <div>633.208 Minimum fire safety standards.—
            <div>(1) The Florida Fire Prevention Code adopted by the State Fire Marshal, which shall operate in conjunction with the Florida Building Code, shall be deemed adopted by each municipality, county, and special district with fire safety responsibilities. The minimum fire safety codes do not apply to buildings and structures subject to the uniform fire safety standards under s. 633.206 and buildings and structures subject to the minimum fire safety standards adopted pursuant to s. 394.879.</div>
            <div>(2) Pursuant to subsection (1), each municipality, county, and special district with fire safety responsibilities shall enforce the Florida Fire Prevention Code as the minimum fire safety code required by this section.</div>
            <div>(3) Such code shall be a minimum code, and a municipality, county, or special district with fire safety responsibilities may adopt more stringent fire safety standards, subject to the requirements of this subsection. Such county, municipality, or special district may establish alternative requirements to those requirements which are required under the minimum fire safety standards on a case-by-case basis, in order to meet special situations arising from historic, geographic, or unusual conditions, if the alternative requirements result in a level of protection to life, safety, or property equal to or greater than the applicable minimum fire safety standards. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “historic” means that the building or structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places of the United States Department of the Interior.
            <div>(a) The local governing body shall determine, following a public hearing which has been advertised in a newspaper of general circulation at least 10 days before the hearing, if there is a need to strengthen the requirements of the minimum fire safety code adopted by such governing body. The determination must be based upon a review of local conditions by the local governing body, which review demonstrates that local conditions justify more stringent requirements than those specified in the minimum fire safety code for the protection of life and property or justify requirements that meet special situations arising from historic, geographic, or unusual conditions.</div>
            <div>(b) Such additional requirements may not be discriminatory as to materials, products, or construction techniques of demonstrated capabilities.</div>
            <div>(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) apply solely to the local enforcing agency’s adoption of requirements more stringent than those specified in the Florida Fire Prevention Code and the Life Safety Code that have the effect of amending building construction standards. Upon request, the enforcing agency must provide a person making application for a building permit, or any state agency or board with construction-related regulation responsibilities, a listing of all such requirements and codes.</div>
            <div>(d) A local government which adopts amendments to the minimum fire safety code must provide a procedure by which the validity of such amendments may be challenged by any substantially affected party to test the amendment’s compliance with this section.
            <div>1. Unless the local government agrees to stay enforcement of the amendment, or other good cause is shown, the challenging party shall be entitled to a hearing on the challenge within 45 days.</div>
            <div>2. For purposes of such challenge, the burden of proof shall be on the challenging party, but the amendment may not be presumed to be valid or invalid.</div>
            </div>
            <p justify"="">This subsection gives local government the authority to establish fire safety codes that exceed the Florida Fire Prevention Code adopted by the State Fire Marshal. The Legislature intends that local government give proper public notice and hold public hearings before adopting more stringent fire safety codes. A substantially affected person may appeal, to the department, the local government’s resolution of the challenge, and the department shall determine if the amendment complies with this section. Actions of the department are subject to judicial review pursuant to s. 120.68. The department shall consider reports of the Florida Building Commission, pursuant to part IV of chapter 553, when evaluating building code enforcement.</p>
            </div>
            <div>(4) The new building or structure provisions enumerated within the Florida Fire Prevention Code adopted pursuant to this section shall apply only to buildings or structures for which the building permit is issued on or after the effective date of the current edition of the Florida Fire Prevention Code. Subject to subsection (5), the existing building or structure provisions enumerated within the fire safety code adopted pursuant to this section shall apply to buildings or structures for which the building permit was issued or the building or structure was constructed before the effective date of this act.</div>
            <div>(5) With regard to existing buildings, the Legislature recognizes that it is not always practical to apply any or all of the provisions of the Florida Fire Prevention Code and that physical limitations may require disproportionate effort or expense with little increase in fire or life safety. Before applying the minimum fire safety code to an existing building, the local fire official shall determine whether a threat to life safety or property exists. If a threat to life safety or property exists, the fire official shall apply the applicable fire safety code for existing buildings to the extent practical to ensure a reasonable degree of life safety and safety of property or shall fashion a reasonable alternative that affords an equivalent degree of life safety and safety of property. The local fire official may consider the fire safety evaluation systems found in NFPA 101A: Guide on Alternative Approaches to Life Safety, adopted by the State Fire Marshal, as acceptable systems for the identification of low-cost, reasonable alternatives. It is acceptable to use the Fire Safety Evaluation System for Board and Care Facilities using prompt evacuation capabilities parameter values on existing residential high-rise buildings. The decision of the local fire official may be appealed to the local administrative board described in s. 553.73.</div>
            <div>(6) Nothing herein shall preclude a municipality, county, or special district from requiring a structure to be maintained in accordance with the Florida Fire Prevention Code.</div>
            <div>(7) Electrically operated single station smoke detectors required for residential buildings are not required to be interconnected within individual living units in all buildings having direct access to the outside from each living unit and having three stories or less. This subsection does not apply to any residential building required to have a manual or an automatic fire alarm system.</div>
            <div>
            <div>(8)(a) The provisions of the Life Safety Code, as contained in the Florida Fire Prevention Code, do not apply to one-family and two-family dwellings. However, fire sprinkler protection may be permitted by local government in lieu of other fire protection-related development requirements for such structures. While local governments may adopt fire sprinkler requirements for one-family and two-family dwellings under this subsection, it is the intent of the Legislature that the economic consequences of the fire sprinkler mandate on home owners be studied before the enactment of such a requirement. After the effective date of this act, any local government that desires to adopt a fire sprinkler requirement on one-family or two-family dwellings must prepare an economic cost and benefit report that analyzes the application of fire sprinklers to one-family or two-family dwellings or any proposed residential subdivision. The report must consider the tradeoffs and specific cost savings and benefits of fire sprinklers for future owners of property. The report must include an assessment of the cost savings from any reduced or eliminated impact fees if applicable, the reduction in special fire district tax, insurance fees, and other taxes or fees imposed, and the waiver of certain infrastructure requirements including the reduction of roadway widths, the reduction of water line sizes, increased fire hydrant spacing, increased dead-end roadway length, and a reduction in cul-de-sac sizes relative to the costs from fire sprinkling. A failure to prepare an economic report shall result in the invalidation of the fire sprinkler requirement to any one-family or two-family dwelling or any proposed subdivision. In addition, a local jurisdiction or utility may not charge any additional fee, above what is charged to a non-fire sprinklered dwelling, on the basis that a one-family or two-family dwelling unit is protected by a fire sprinkler system.</div>
            <div>
            <div>(b)1. A county, municipality, special taxing district, public utility, or private utility may not require an impact fee or payment for a separate water connection for a one-family or two-family dwelling fire sprinkler system if the capacity required is hydraulically available at the property line. The accountholder of the one-family or two-family dwelling must notify the county, municipality, special district, public utility, or private utility of the installation of the separate water connection in the applicable permit. The separate water connection may only be used for one-family or two-family dwelling fire sprinkler systems and if used for other purposes, full base and volume charges may be applied.</div>
            <div>2. A county, municipality, special district, public utility, or private utility may not charge a water or sewer rate to a one-family or two-family dwelling that requires a larger water meter solely due to the installation of fire sprinklers above that which is charged to a one-family and two-family dwelling with a base meter. If the installation of fire sprinklers in a one-family or two-family dwelling requires the installation of a larger water meter, only the difference in actual cost between the base water meter and the larger water meter may be charged by the water utility provider.</div>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(9) Before imposing a fire sprinkler requirement on any one- or two-family dwelling, a local government must provide the owner of any one- or two-family dwelling a letter documenting specific infrastructure or other tax or fee allowances and waivers that are listed in but not limited to those described in subsection (8) for the dwelling. The documentation must show that the cost savings reasonably approximate the cost of the purchase and installation of a fire protection system.</div>
            <div>(10) Notwithstanding subsection (8), a property owner may not be required to install fire sprinklers in any residential property based upon the use of such property as a rental property or any change in or reclassification of the property’s primary use to a rental property.</div>

            <div>633.212 Legislative intent; informal interpretations of the Florida Fire Prevention Code.—It is the intent of the Legislature that the Florida Fire Prevention Code be interpreted by fire officials and local enforcement agencies in a manner that reasonably and cost-effectively protects the public safety, health, and welfare; ensures uniform interpretations throughout this state; and provides just and expeditious processes for resolving disputes regarding such interpretations. It is the further intent of the Legislature that such processes provide for the expeditious resolution of the issues presented and that the resulting interpretation of such issues be published on the website of the division.
            <div>(1) The division shall by rule establish an informal process of rendering nonbinding interpretations of the Florida Fire Prevention Code. The division may contract with and refer interpretive issues to a third party, selected based upon cost effectiveness, quality of services to be performed, and other performance-based criteria, which has experience in interpreting and enforcing the Florida Fire Prevention Code. It is the intent of the Legislature that the division establish a Fire Code Interpretation Committee composed of seven persons and seven alternates, equally representing each area of the state, to which a party can pose questions regarding the interpretation of the Florida Fire Prevention Code provisions. The alternate member may respond to a nonbinding interpretation if a member is unable to respond.</div>
            <div>(2) Each member and alternate member of the Fire Code Interpretation Committee must be certified as a fire safety inspector pursuant to s. 633.216(2) and must have a minimum of 5 years of experience interpreting and enforcing the Florida Fire Prevention Code. Each member and alternate member must be approved by the division and deemed by the division to have met these requirements for at least 30 days before participating in a review of a nonbinding interpretation.</div>
            <div>(3) Each nonbinding interpretation of code provisions must be provided within 15 business days after receipt of a request for interpretation. The response period established in this subsection may be waived only with the written consent of the party requesting the nonbinding interpretation and the division. Nonbinding interpretations shall be advisory only and nonbinding on the parties or the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(4) In order to administer this section, the division shall charge a fee for nonbinding interpretations. The fee may not exceed $150 for each request for a review or interpretation. The division may authorize payment of fees directly to the nonprofit organization under contract pursuant to subsection (1).</div>
            <div>(5) A party requesting a nonbinding interpretation who disagrees with the interpretation issued under this section may apply for a declaratory statement from the State Fire Marshal pursuant to s. 633.104(6).</div>
            <div>(6) The division shall issue or cause to be issued a nonbinding interpretation of the Florida Fire Prevention Code pursuant to this section when requested to do so upon submission of a petition by a fire official or by the owner or owner’s representative or the contractor or contractor’s representative of a project in dispute. The division shall adopt a petition form by rule, and the petition form must be published on the State Fire Marshal’s website. The form must, at a minimum, require:
            <div>(a) The name and address of the local fire official, including the address of the county, municipality, or special district.</div>
            <div>(b) The name and address of the owner or owner’s representative or the contractor or contractor’s representative.</div>
            <div>(c) A statement of the specific sections of the Florida Fire Prevention Code being interpreted by the local fire official.</div>
            <div>(d) An explanation of how the petitioner’s substantial interests are being affected by the local interpretation of the Florida Fire Prevention Code.</div>
            <div>(e) A statement of the interpretation of the specific sections of the Florida Fire Prevention Code by the local fire official.</div>
            <div>(f) A statement of the interpretation that the petitioner contends should be given to the specific sections of the Florida Fire Prevention Code and a statement supporting the petitioner’s interpretation.</div>
            <div>(g) A single question that is capable of being answered with a “yes” or “no” response.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(7) Upon receipt of a petition that meets the requirements of subsection (6), the division shall immediately provide copies of the petition to the Fire Code Interpretation Committee, and shall publish the petition and any response submitted by the local fire official on the State Fire Marshal’s website.</div>
            <div>(8) The committee shall conduct proceedings as necessary to resolve the issues and give due regard to the petition, the facts of the matter at issue, specific code sections cited, and any statutory implications affecting the Florida Fire Prevention Code. The committee shall issue an interpretation regarding the provisions of the Florida Fire Prevention Code within 15 days after the filing of a petition. The committee shall issue an interpretation based upon the Florida Fire Prevention Code or, if the code is ambiguous, the intent of the code. The committee’s interpretation shall be provided to the petitioner and shall include a notice that if the petitioner disagrees with the interpretation, the petitioner may file a request for a declaratory statement by the State Fire Marshal under s. 633.104(6). The committee’s interpretation shall be provided to the State Fire Marshal, and the division shall publish the declaratory statement on the State Fire Marshal’s website and in the Florida Administrative Register.</div>

            <div>633.214 Ordinances relating to fire safety; definitions; penalties.—
            <div>(1) As used in this section:
            <div>(a) A “fire safety inspector” is an individual certified by the division, officially assigned the duties of conducting fire safety inspections of buildings and facilities on a recurring or regular basis, investigating civil infractions relating to fire safety, and issuing citations pursuant to this section on behalf of the state or any county, municipality, or special district with fire safety responsibilities.</div>

            </div>
            <div>(c) “Ordinance” means any ordinance enacted by the governing body of a county or municipality that is a civil infraction relating to fire safety codes.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) A county or municipality that has created a code enforcement board or special magistrate system pursuant to chapter 162 may enforce fire safety code violations as provided in chapter 162. The governing body of a county or municipality which has not created a code enforcement board or special magistrate system for fire safety under chapter 162 may enact ordinances relating to fire safety codes, which ordinances shall provide:
            <div>(a) That a violation of such an ordinance is a civil infraction.</div>
            <div>(b) A maximum civil penalty not to exceed $500.</div>

            <div>633.216 Inspection of buildings and equipment; orders; fire safety inspection training requirements; certification; disciplinary action.—The State Fire Marshal and her or his agents or persons authorized to enforce laws and rules of the State Fire Marshal shall, at any reasonable hour, when the State Fire Marshal has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of this chapter or s. 509.215, or a rule adopted thereunder, or a minimum fire safety code adopted by the State Fire Marshal or a local authority, may exist, inspect any and all buildings and structures which are subject to the requirements of this chapter or s. 509.215 and rules adopted thereunder. The authority to inspect shall extend to all equipment, vehicles, and chemicals which are located on or within the premises of any such building or structure.
            <div>(1) Each county, municipality, and special district that has fire safety enforcement responsibilities shall employ or contract with a fire safety inspector. Except as provided in s. 633.312(2) and (3), the fire safety inspector must conduct all fire safety inspections that are required by law. The governing body of a county, municipality, or special district that has fire safety enforcement responsibilities may provide a schedule of fees to pay only the costs of inspections conducted pursuant to this subsection and related administrative expenses. Two or more counties, municipalities, or special districts that have fire safety enforcement responsibilities may jointly employ or contract with a fire safety inspector.</div>
            <div>(2) Except as provided in s. 633.312(2), every fire safety inspection conducted pursuant to state or local fire safety requirements shall be by a person certified as having met the inspection training requirements set by the State Fire Marshal. Such person shall meet the requirements of s. 633.412(1)-(4), and:
            <div>(a) Have satisfactorily completed the fire safety inspector certification examination as prescribed by division rule; and</div>
            <div>
            <div>(b)1. Have satisfactorily completed, as determined by division rule, a fire safety inspector training program of at least 200 hours established by the department and administered by education or training providers approved by the department for the purpose of providing basic certification training for fire safety inspectors; or</div>

            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) A firefighter certified pursuant to s. 633.408 may conduct fire safety inspections, under the supervision of a certified fire safety inspector, while on duty as a member of a fire department company conducting in-service fire safety inspections without being certified as a fire safety inspector, if such firefighter has satisfactorily completed an in-service fire department company inspector training program of at least 24 hours’ duration as provided by rule of the department.</div>
            <div>(4) Every fire safety inspector certificate is valid for a period of 4 years from the date of issuance. Renewal of certification is subject to the affected person’s completing proper application for renewal and meeting all of the requirements for renewal as established under this chapter or by rule adopted under this chapter, which must include completion of at least 54 hours during the preceding 4-year period of continuing education as required by the rule of the department or, in lieu thereof, successful passage of an examination as established by the department.</div>

            <div>(6) The State Fire Marshal may deny, refuse to renew, suspend, or revoke the certificate of a fire safety inspector if the State Fire Marshal finds that any of the following grounds exist:
            <div>(a) Any cause for which issuance of a certificate could have been refused had it then existed and been known to the division.</div>
            <div>(b) Violation of this chapter or any rule or order of the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(c) Falsification of records relating to the certificate.</div>
            <div>(d) Failure to meet any of the renewal requirements.</div>
            <div>(e) Making or filing a report or record that the certificate holder knows to be false, or knowingly inducing another to file a false report or record, or knowingly failing to file a report or record required by state or local law, or knowingly impeding or obstructing such filing, or knowingly inducing another person to impede or obstruct such filing.</div>
            <div>(f) Failing to properly enforce applicable fire codes or permit requirements within this state which the certificate holder knows are applicable by committing willful misconduct, gross negligence, gross misconduct, repeated negligence, or negligence resulting in a significant danger to life or property.</div>
            <div>(g) Accepting labor, services, or materials at no charge or at a noncompetitive rate from a person who performs work that is under the enforcement authority of the certificate holder and who is not an immediate family member of the certificate holder. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “immediate family member” means a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle, or first cousin of the person or the person’s spouse or a person who resides in the primary residence of the certificate holder.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(7) The division and the Florida Building Code Administrators and Inspectors Board, established pursuant to s. 468.605, shall enter into a reciprocity agreement to facilitate joint recognition of continuing education recertification hours for certificate holders licensed under s. 468.609 and fire safety inspectors certified under subsection (2).</div>

            <div>633.218 Inspections of state buildings and premises; tests of fire safety equipment; building plans to be approved.—
            <div>
            <div>(1)(a) It is the duty of the State Fire Marshal and her or his agents to inspect, or cause to be inspected, each state-owned building on a recurring basis established by rule, and to ensure that high-hazard occupancies are inspected at least annually, for the purpose of ascertaining and causing to be corrected any conditions liable to cause fire or endanger life from fire and any violation of the fire safety standards for state-owned buildings, this chapter, or the rules adopted pursuant hereto. The State Fire Marshal shall, within 7 days following an inspection, submit a report of such inspection to the head of the state agency responsible for the building.</div>
            <div>(b) Except as provided in s. 255.45, the department head is responsible for ensuring that deficiencies noted in the inspection are corrected as soon as practicable.</div>
            <div>(c) Each department shall, in its annual budget proposal, include requests for sufficient funds to correct any fire safety deficiencies noted by the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(d) Each department shall, in its annual budget proposal and for all proposals for new construction or renovations to existing structures, include requests for sufficient funds to pay for any charges or fees imposed by the State Fire Marshal for review of plans, renovations, occupancy, or inspections, whether recurring or high hazard.</div>
            <div>(e) For purposes of this section:
            <div>
            <div>1.a. The term “high-hazard occupancy” means any building or structure:
            <div>(I) That contains combustible or explosive matter or flammable conditions dangerous to the safety of life or property;</div>
            <div>(II) At which persons receive educational instruction;</div>
            <div>(III) At which persons reside, excluding private dwellings; or</div>
            <div>(IV) Containing three or more floor levels.</div>
            </div>
            <div>b. As used in this subparagraph, the phrase “building or structure”:
            <div>(I) Includes, but is not limited to, all hospitals and residential health care facilities, nursing homes and other adult care facilities, correctional or detention facilities, public schools, public lodging establishments, migrant labor camps, residential child care facilities, and self-service gasoline stations.</div>
            <div>(II) Does not include any residential condominium where the declaration of condominium or the bylaws provide that the rental of units shall not be permitted for less than 90 days.</div>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>2. The term “state-owned building” includes private correctional facilities as defined under s. 944.710(3).</div>

            <div>(f) A state-owned building or state-leased building or space shall be identified through use of the United States National Grid Coordinate System.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) The State Fire Marshal and her or his agents may conduct performance tests on any electronic fire warning and smoke detection system, and any pressurized air-handling unit, in any state-owned building or state-leased building or space on a recurring basis as provided in subsection (1). The State Fire Marshal and her or his agents shall also ensure that fire drills are conducted in all high-hazard state-owned buildings or high-hazard state-leased occupancies at least annually.</div>
            <div>(3) All construction of any new state-owned building or state-leased building or space or any renovation, alteration, or change of occupancy of any existing, state-owned building or state-leased building or space must comply with the uniform fire safety standards of the State Fire Marshal.
            <div>(a) For all new construction or renovation, alteration, or change of occupancy of state-leased space, compliance with the uniform fire safety standards shall be determined by reviewing the plans for the proposed construction or occupancy submitted by the lessor to the division for review and approval before commencement of construction or occupancy, which review shall be completed within 10 working days after receipt of the plans by the division.</div>
            <div>(b) The plans for all construction of any new, or renovation or alteration of any existing, state-owned building are subject to the review and approval of the division for compliance with the uniform fire safety standards before commencement of construction or change of occupancy, which review shall be completed within 30 calendar days of receipt of the plans by the division.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) The division may inspect state-owned buildings and space and state-leased buildings and space as necessary before occupancy or during construction, renovation, or alteration to ascertain compliance with the uniform fire safety standards. Whenever the division determines by virtue of such inspection or by review of plans that construction, renovation, or alteration of state-owned buildings and state-leased buildings or space is not in compliance with the uniform fire safety standards, the division shall issue an order to cease construction, renovation, or alteration, or to preclude occupancy, of a building until compliance is obtained, except for those activities required to achieve such compliance.</div>
            <div>(5) The division shall by rule provide a schedule of fees to pay for the costs of the inspections, whether recurring or high hazard, any fire safety review or plans for proposed construction, renovations, or occupancy, and related administrative expenses.</div>

            </div>
            <div>(3) The State Fire Marshal’s term on the board, or that of her or his designee, shall coincide with the State Fire Marshal’s term of office. All terms are for 4 years and expire on June 30 of the last year of the term.

            </div>
            <div>633.304 Fire suppression equipment; license to install or maintain.—
            <div>(1) It is unlawful for any organization or individual to engage in the business of servicing, repairing, recharging, testing, marking, inspecting, installing, or hydrotesting any fire extinguisher or pre-engineered system in this state except in conformity with this chapter. Each organization or individual that engages in such activity must possess a valid and subsisting license issued by the division. All fire extinguishers and pre-engineered systems required by statute or by rule must be serviced by an organization or individual licensed under this chapter. A licensee who receives appropriate training shall not be prohibited by a manufacturer from servicing any particular brand of fire extinguisher or pre-engineered system. The licensee is legally qualified to act for the business organization in all matters connected with its business, and the licensee must supervise all activities undertaken by such business organization. Each licensee shall maintain a specific business location. A further requirement, in the case of multiple locations where such servicing or recharging is taking place, is that each licensee who maintains more than one place of business where actual work is carried on must possess an additional license, as set forth in this section, for each location, except that a licensed individual may not qualify for more than five locations. A licensee is limited to a specific type of work performed depending upon the class of license held. Licenses are required for the following:
            <div>(a) Class A: To service, recharge, repair, install, or inspect all types of fire extinguishers and to conduct hydrostatic tests on all types of fire extinguishers.</div>
            <div>(b) Class B: To service, recharge, repair, install, or inspect all types of fire extinguishers, including recharging carbon dioxide units and conducting hydrostatic tests on all types of fire extinguishers, except carbon dioxide units.</div>
            <div>(c) Class C: To service, recharge, repair, install, or inspect all types of fire extinguishers, except recharging carbon dioxide units, and to conduct hydrostatic tests on all types of fire extinguishers, except carbon dioxide units.</div>
            <div>(d) Class D: To service, repair, recharge, hydrotest, install, or inspect all types of pre-engineered fire extinguishing systems.</div>
            <p justify"="">Any fire equipment dealer licensed pursuant to this subsection who does not want to engage in the business of servicing, inspecting, recharging, repairing, hydrotesting, or installing halon equipment must file an affidavit on a form provided by the division so stating. Licenses will be issued by the division to show the work authorized thereunder. It is unlawful, unlicensed activity for a person or firm to falsely hold himself or herself or a business organization out to perform any service, inspection, recharge, repair, hydrotest, or installation except as specifically described in the license. A fire equipment dealer licensed pursuant to this subsection who wishes to withdraw a previously filed halon equipment exemption affidavit and engage in the business of servicing, inspecting, recharging, repairing, hydrotesting, or installing halon equipment must submit a written statement requesting the withdrawal to the division. The dealer must also submit to an inspection by the State Fire Marshal or her or his designee in order to determine that the dealer possesses the equipment required to service, inspect, recharge, repair, hydrotest, or install halon equipment.</p>
            </div>
            <div>(2) A person who holds a valid fire equipment dealer license may maintain such license in an inactive status during which time he or she may not engage in any work under the definition of the license held. An inactive status license is void 4 years after the approval date of the inactive status application. To maintain inactive status, the inactive licensee must submit proof of continuing education and the inactive status fee before December 31 of each odd-numbered year.</div>
            <div>(3) Each individual actually performing the work of servicing, recharging, repairing, hydrotesting, installing, testing, or inspecting fire extinguishers or pre-engineered systems must possess a valid and subsisting permit issued by the division. Permittees are limited as to specific type of work performed to allow work no more extensive than the class of license held by the licensee under whom the permittee is working. Permits will be issued by the division as follows:
            <div>(a) Portable permit: “Portable permittee” means a person who is limited to performing work no more extensive than the employing or contractually related licensee in the servicing, recharging, repairing, installing, or inspecting all types of portable fire extinguishers.</div>
            <div>(b) pre-engineered permit: “pre-engineered permittee” means a person who is limited to the servicing, recharging, repairing, installing, or inspecting of all types of pre-engineered fire extinguishing systems.</div>
            <p justify"="">Any fire equipment permittee licensed pursuant to this subsection who does not want to engage in servicing, inspecting, recharging, repairing, hydrotesting, or installing halon equipment must file an affidavit on a form provided by the division so stating. Permits will be issued by the division to show the work authorized thereunder. It is unlawful, unlicensed activity for a person or firm to falsely hold himself or herself out to perform any service, inspection, recharge, repair, hydrotest, or installation except as specifically described in the permit.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
            <div>(4)(a) Such licenses and permits shall be issued by the division for 2 years beginning January 1, 2000, and each 2-year period thereafter and expiring December 31 of the second year. All licenses or permits issued will expire on December 31 of each odd-numbered year. The failure to renew a license or permit by December 31 of the second year will cause the license or permit to become inoperative. The holder of an inoperative license or permit may not engage in any activities for which a license or permit is required by this section. A license or permit which is inoperative because of the failure to renew it shall be restored upon payment of the applicable fee plus a penalty equal to the applicable fee, if the application for renewal is filed no later than the following March 31. If the application for restoration is not made before the March 31st deadline, the fee for restoration shall be equal to the original application fee and the penalty provided for herein, and, in addition, the State Fire Marshal shall require reexamination of the applicant. The fee for a license or permit issued for 1 year or less shall be prorated at 50 percent of the applicable fee for a biennial license or permit.</div>
            <div>(b) After initial licensure, each licensee or permittee must successfully complete a course or courses of continuing education for fire equipment technicians of at least 16 hours. A license or permit may not be renewed unless the licensee or permittee produces documentation of the completion of at least 16 hours of continuing education for fire equipment technicians during the biennial licensure period. A person who is both a licensee and a permittee shall complete 16 hours of continuing education during each renewal period. Each licensee shall ensure that all permittees in his or her employment or through a contractual agreement meet their continuing education requirements. The State Fire Marshal shall adopt rules describing the continuing education requirements and shall have the authority upon reasonable belief, to audit a fire equipment dealer to determine compliance with continuing education requirements.</div>
            <div>(c) The forms of such licenses and permits and applications therefor must be prescribed by the State Fire Marshal; in addition to such other information and data as that officer determines is appropriate and required for such forms, there must be included in such forms the following matters. Each such application must be in such form as to provide that the data and other information set forth therein shall be sworn to by the applicant or, if a corporation, by an officer thereof. An application for a permit must include the name of the licensee employing, or contractually related to, such permittee, and the permit issued in pursuance of such application must also set forth the name of such licensee. A permit is valid solely for use by the holder thereof in his or her employment by, or contractual relationship with, the licensee named in the permit.</div>
            <div>(d) A license of any class may not be issued or renewed by the division and a license of any class does not remain operative unless:
            <div>1. The applicant has submitted to the State Fire Marshal evidence of registration as a Florida corporation or evidence of compliance with s. 865.09.</div>
            <div>2. The State Fire Marshal or his or her designee has by inspection determined that the applicant possesses the equipment required for the class of license sought. The State Fire Marshal shall give an applicant a reasonable opportunity to correct any deficiencies discovered by inspection. To obtain such inspection, an applicant with facilities located outside this state must:
            <div>a. Provide a notarized statement from a professional engineer licensed by the applicant’s state of domicile certifying that the applicant possesses the equipment required for the class of license sought and that all such equipment is operable; or</div>
            <div>b. Allow the State Fire Marshal or her or his designee to inspect the facility. All costs associated with the State Fire Marshal’s inspection must be paid by the applicant. The State Fire Marshal, in accordance with s. 120.54, may adopt rules to establish standards for the calculation and establishment of the amount of costs associated with any inspection conducted by the State Fire Marshal under this section. Such rules must include procedures for invoicing and receiving funds in advance of the inspection.</div>
            </div>
            <div>3. The applicant has submitted to the State Fire Marshal proof of insurance providing coverage for comprehensive general liability for bodily injury and property damage, products liability, completed operations, and contractual liability. The State Fire Marshal shall adopt rules providing for the amounts of such coverage, but such amounts may not be less than $300,000 for Class A or Class D licenses, $200,000 for Class B licenses, and $100,000 for Class C licenses; and the total coverage for any class of license held in conjunction with a Class D license may not be less than $300,000. The State Fire Marshal may, at any time after the issuance of a license or its renewal, require upon demand, and in no event more than 30 days after notice of such demand, the licensee to provide proof of insurance, on the insurer’s form, containing confirmation of insurance coverage as required by this chapter. Failure, for any length of time, to provide proof of insurance coverage as required must result in the immediate suspension of the license until proof of proper insurance is provided to the State Fire Marshal. An insurer that provides such coverage shall notify the State Fire Marshal of any change in coverage or of any termination, cancellation, or non-renewal of any coverage.</div>
            <div>4. The applicant applies to the State Fire Marshal, provides proof of experience, and successfully completes a prescribed training course offered by the State Fire College or an equivalent course approved by the State Fire Marshal. This subparagraph does not apply to any holder of or applicant for a permit under paragraph (g) or to a business organization or a governmental entity seeking initial licensure or renewal of an existing license solely for the purpose of inspecting, servicing, repairing, marking, recharging, and maintaining fire extinguishers used and located on the premises of and owned by such organization or entity.</div>
            <div>5. The applicant has a current retestor identification number that is appropriate for the license for which the applicant is applying and that is listed with the United States Department of Transportation.</div>
            <div>6. The applicant has passed, with a grade of at least 70 percent, a written examination testing his or her knowledge of the rules and statutes governing the activities authorized by the license and demonstrating his or her knowledge and ability to perform those tasks in a competent, lawful, and safe manner. Such examination must be developed and administered by the State Fire Marshal, or his or her designee in accordance with policies and procedures of the State Fire Marshal. An applicant shall pay a non-refundable examination fee of $50 for each examination or reexamination scheduled. A reexamination may not be scheduled sooner than 30 days after any administration of an examination to an applicant. An applicant may not be permitted to take an examination for any level of license more than a total of four times during 1 year, regardless of the number of applications submitted. As a prerequisite to licensure of the applicant, he or she:
            <div>a. Must be at least 18 years of age.</div>
            <div>b. Must have 4 years of proven experience as a fire equipment permittee at a level equal to or greater than the level of license applied for or have a combination of education and experience determined to be equivalent thereto by the State Fire Marshal. Having held a permit at the appropriate level for the required period constitutes the required experience.</div>
            <div>c. Must not have been convicted of a felony or a crime punishable by imprisonment of 1 year or more under the law of the United States or of any state thereof or under the law of any other country. “Convicted” means a finding of guilt or the acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere in any federal or state court or a court in any other country, without regard to whether a judgment of conviction has been entered by the court having jurisdiction of the case. If an applicant has been convicted of any such felony, the applicant is excluded from licensure for a period of 4 years after expiration of sentence or final release by the Florida Commission on Offender Review unless the applicant, before the expiration of the 4-year period, has received a full pardon or has had her or his civil rights restored.</div>
            <p justify"="">This subparagraph does not apply to any holder of or applicant for a permit under paragraph (g) or to a business organization or a governmental entity seeking initial licensure or renewal of an existing license solely for the purpose of inspecting, servicing, repairing, marking, recharging, hydrotesting, and maintaining fire extinguishers used and located on the premises of and owned by such organization or entity.</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(e) A fire equipment dealer licensed under this section may apply to convert the license currently held to a higher licensing category, if the licensed dealer:
            <div>1. Submits an application for the license on a form in conformance with paragraph (c). The application must be accompanied by a fee as prescribed in s. 633.132 for the type of license requested.</div>
            <div>2. Provides evidence of 2 years’ experience as a licensed dealer and meets such relevant educational requirements as are established by rule by the State Fire Marshal for purposes of upgrading a license.</div>

            <div>(1) The violation of any provision of this chapter or any rule adopted pursuant hereto or the failure or refusal to comply with any notice or order to correct a violation or any cease and desist order by a person who possesses a license or permit issued pursuant to s. 633.304 is cause for denial, non-renewal, revocation, or suspension of such license or permit by the State Fire Marshal after such officer has determined that the person committed such violation. An order of suspension must state the period of such suspension, which period may not be in excess of 2 years from the date of such order. An order of revocation may be entered for a period not exceeding 5 years. Such orders shall effect suspension or revocation of all licenses or permits issued by the division to the person, and during such period a license or permit may not be issued by the division to such person. During the suspension or revocation of any license or permit, the former licensee or permittee may not engage in or attempt or profess to engage in any transaction or business for which a license or permit is required under this chapter or directly or indirectly own, control, or be employed in any manner by any firm, business, or corporation for which a license or permit under this chapter is required. If, during the period between the beginning of proceedings and the entry of an order of suspension or revocation by the State Fire Marshal, a new license or permit has been issued by the division to the person so charged, the order of suspension or revocation shall operate to suspend or revoke such new license or permit held by such person.</div>

            <div>(c) Any person who is or has been an officer, qualifier, director, stockholder, or owner of a firm or corporation, or who was interested directly or indirectly in a firm or corporation, the license or permit of which has been suspended or revoked under this chapter.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) In addition to the grounds set forth in subsection (1), it is cause for denial, non-renewal, revocation, or suspension of a license or permit by the State Fire Marshal if she or he determines that the licensee or permittee has:

The State Fire Marshal may adopt rules to administer this subsection.</div>
            <div>(f) As a prerequisite to taking the examination for certification as a Contractor V, the applicant must be at least 18 years old, be of good moral character, and have been licensed as a certified underground utility and excavation contractor or certified plumbing contractor pursuant to chapter 489, have verification by an individual who is licensed as a certified utility contractor or certified plumbing contractor pursuant to chapter 489 that the applicant has 4 years’ proven experience in the employ of a certified underground utility and excavation contractor or certified plumbing contractor, or have a combination of education and experience equivalent to 4 years’ proven experience in the employ of a certified underground utility and excavation contractor or certified plumbing contractor.</div>
            <div>(g) Within 30 days after the date of the examination, the division shall inform the applicant in writing whether she or he has qualified or not and, if the applicant has qualified, that she or he is eligible to be issued a certificate of competency, subject to compliance with the requirements of subsection (4).</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) As a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate, the division must require the applicant to submit satisfactory evidence that she or he has obtained insurance providing coverage for comprehensive general liability for bodily injury and property damages, products liability, completed operations, and contractual liability. The division may adopt rules providing for the amount of insurance, but such amount shall not be less than $500,000 for a Contractor I, Contractor II, Contractor III, or Contractor V and shall not be less than $250,000 for a Contractor IV. An insurer which provides such coverage shall notify the division within 30 days of any material change in coverage or any termination, cancellation, or non-renewal of such coverage. An insurer which fails to so notify the division shall be subject to the penalties provided under s. 624.4211.</div>
            <div>(5) Upon satisfaction of the requirements of subsections (1), (2), (3), and (4), the certificate shall be issued forthwith. However, no certificate shall remain in effect if, after issuance, the certificate holder fails to maintain the insurance coverage required by this section.</div>
            <div>(6) If an applicant for an original certificate, after having been notified to do so, does not appear for examination or does not pass the examination within 1 year from the date of filing her or his application, the fee paid by the applicant shall be forfeited. New applications for a certificate shall be accompanied by another application fee fixed by this chapter.</div>
            <div>(7) The State Fire Marshal may, at any time subsequent to the issuance of the certificate or its renewal, require, upon demand and in no event more than 30 days after notice of the demand, the certificate holder to provide proof of insurance coverage on the insurer’s form containing confirmation of insurance coverage as required by this chapter. Failure to provide proof of insurance coverage as required, for any length of time, shall result in the immediate suspension of the certificate until proof of insurance is provided to the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(8) An individual employed by a Contractor I or Contractor II certificate holder, as established in this section, who will be inspecting water-based fire protection systems as required under s. 633.312, must be issued a permit by the division to conduct such work. The permit is valid solely for use by the holder thereof in his or her employment by the certificate holder named in the permit. A permittee must have a valid and subsisting permit upon his or her person at all times while engaging in inspecting fire protection systems, and a permit holder must be able to produce such a permit upon demand. In addition, a permittee shall, at all times while performing inspections, carry an identification card containing his or her photograph and other identifying information as prescribed by the State Fire Marshal, and the permittee must produce the identification card and information upon demand. The permit and the identification may be one and the same. A permittee is limited as to the specific type of work performed, depending upon the class of certificate held by the certificate holder under whom the permittee is working. The permit class shall be known as a Water-Based Fire Protection Inspector whose permit allows the holder to inspect water sprinkler systems, water spray systems, foam-water sprinkler systems, foam-water spray systems, standpipes, combination standpipes and sprinkler systems, all piping that is an integral part of the system beginning at the point where the piping is used exclusively for fire protection, sprinkler tank heaters, air lines, thermal systems used in connection with sprinklers, and tanks and pumps connected thereto, excluding pre-engineered systems.</div>
            <div>(9) It is the intent of the Legislature that the inspections and testing of automatic fire sprinkler systems for detached one-family dwellings, detached two-family dwellings, and mobile homes be accomplished by the owner, who is responsible for requesting service from a contractor when necessary. It is further intended that the NFPA-25 inspection of exposed underground piping and any attached appurtenances supplying a fire protection system be conducted by a Contractor I or Contractor II.</div>
            <div>(10) The State Fire Marshal shall require the National Institute of Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET), Sub-field of Inspection and Testing of Fire Protection Systems Level II or equivalent training and education as determined by the division as proof that the permit holders are knowledgeable about nationally accepted standards for the inspection of fire protection systems.</div>
            <div>(11) It is intended that a certificate holder, or a permit holder who is employed by a certificate holder, conduct inspections required by this chapter. It is understood that after July 1, 2008, employee turnover may result in a depletion of personnel who are certified under the NICET Sub-field of Inspection and Testing of Fire Protection Systems Level II or equivalent training and education as required by the division. A certificate holder may obtain a provisional permit with an endorsement for inspection, testing, and maintenance of water-based fire extinguishing systems for an employee if the employee has initiated procedures for obtaining Level II certification from the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies Sub-field of Inspection and Testing of Fire Protection Systems and achieved Level I certification or an equivalent level as determined by the State Fire Marshal through verification of experience, training, and examination. The division may establish rules to administer this subsection. After 2 years of provisional certification, the employee must have achieved NICET Level II certification or obtain equivalent training and education as determined by the division, or cease performing inspections requiring Level II certification. The provisional permit is valid only for the 2 calendar years after the date of issuance, may not be extended, and is not renewable. After the initial 2-year provisional permit expires, the certificate holder must wait 2 additional years before a new provisional permit may be issued. The intent is to prohibit the certificate holder from using employees who never reach NICET Level II status, or equivalent training and education as determined by the division, by continuously obtaining provisional permits.</div>

            <div>633.328 Issuance of certificate to individuals and business organizations.—
            <div>(1) When an individual proposes to do business in her or his own name, certifications, when granted, shall be issued only to that individual.</div>
            <div>(2) If the applicant proposing to engage in contracting is a business organization, such as a partnership, corporation, business trust, or other legal entity, the application shall state the name of the partnership and its partners, the name of the corporation and its officers and directors, the name of the business trust and its trustees, or the name of such other legal entity and its members and shall furnish evidence of statutory compliance if a fictitious name is used. Such application shall also show that the person applying for the examination is an employee of and is legally qualified to act for the business organization in all matters connected with its contracting business and that she or he has authority to supervise and will supervise any construction undertaken by such business organization. The certification, when issued upon application of a business organization, shall be in the name of such business organization, and the name of the qualifying individual or individuals shall be noted thereon.</div>
            <div>
            <div>(3)(a) At least one member or supervising employee of the business organization as designated to the State Fire Marshal by such organization shall be certified under this chapter in order for the business organization to hold a current certificate as a contractor. If any individual so certified on behalf of such business organization ceases to be affiliated with such business organization, she or he shall inform the State Fire Marshal as provided in paragraph (b). A certified individual who is the sole contractor on behalf of a business organization may not affiliate simultaneously with another business organization. In addition, if such individual was the only certified individual affiliated with the business organization, the business organization shall immediately notify the State Fire Marshal of the individual’s termination and shall have a grace period of 60 days from the date of termination in which to certify another person under the provisions of this chapter, failing which the certification of the business organization shall expire without further operation of law.</div>
            <div>(b) The certified individual shall also inform the State Fire Marshal in writing when she or he proposes to engage in contracting in her or his own name or to affiliate with another business organization, and she or he or such new business organization shall supply the same information to the State Fire Marshal as is required of applicants under this chapter. Each certified individual must pay to the department an amount equal to the original fee for certification of a new business entity.</div>
            <div>(c) In the event of the death of a sole proprietor or in the event that a business organization has only one certificate holder and that person dies, the individual’s estate or personal representative or the business organization, as the case may be, shall immediately notify the State Fire Marshal of the individual’s death and shall have a grace period of 60 days from the date of death in which to certify another person under the provisions of this chapter, failing which the certification of the business organization shall expire without further operation of law.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) If the certified business organization makes application for an occupational license in any municipality or county of this state, the application must be made with the tax collector in the name of the business organization, and the license, when issued, shall be issued to the business organization upon payment of the appropriate licensing fee and exhibition to the tax collector of a valid certificate issued by the division.</div>

            <div>633.332 Certificate; expiration; renewal; inactive certificate; continuing education.—
            <div>(1) Certificates shall expire every 2 years at midnight on June 30. All certificates must be renewed every 2 years. The failure to renew a certificate before June 30 shall cause the certificate to become inoperative, and it is unlawful thereafter for a person to engage, offer to engage, or hold herself or himself out as engaging in contracting under the certificate unless the certificate is restored or reissued. A certificate which is inoperative because of failure to renew shall be restored on payment of the proper renewal fee if the application for restoration is made within 90 days after June 30. If the application for restoration is not made within the 90-day period, the fee for restoration must be equal to the original application fee, and, in addition, the State Fire Marshal must require examination or reexamination of the applicant.</div>
            <div>(2) A person who holds a valid certificate may maintain such certificate in an inactive status during which time she or he may not engage in contracting. An inactive status certificate shall be void after a 2-year period. An inactive status certificate may be reactivated upon application to the State Fire Marshal and payment of the initial application fee.</div>
            <div>
            <div>(3)(a) A certificate for the Contractor I, II, and III classifications as defined in this chapter may not be renewed unless the certificate holder produces documentation of at least 32 contact hours of continuing education in the fire protection discipline during the biennial licensure period. Holders of Contractor IV certificates are required to obtain 14 contact hours of continuing education encompassing the appropriate National Fire Protection Association fire sprinkler documents before renewal. Holders of Contractor V certificates are required to obtain 14 contact hours of continuing education before renewal, at least 1 hour of which is in the fire protection discipline. Any continuing education hours approved pursuant to chapter 489 by the Construction Industry Licensing Board for underground utility and excavation contractors shall be considered as also approved to comply with Contractor V continuing education requirements. A Contractor V certificate holder shall provide to the State Fire Marshal evidence of approval of such coursework by the Construction Industry Licensing Board.</div>
            <div>(b) Any continuing education hours approved by the department for a Contractor I, Contractor II, Contractor III, Contractor IV, or Contractor V certificate holder shall be considered as also approved to comply with continuing education requirements for licensees under the Construction Industry Licensing Board. Such continuing education requirements under this section may include seminars and conferences if the program and subject thereof is acceptable to the State Fire Marshal.</div>
            <div>(c) The contact hours of continuing education must be obtained within the licensure period.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) The renewal period for the permit class is the same as that for the employing certificate holder. The continuing education requirements for permit holders are what is required to maintain NICET Sub-field of Inspection and Testing of Fire Protection Systems Level II, equivalent training and education as determined by the division, or higher certification plus 8 contact hours of continuing education approved by the State Fire Marshal during each biennial renewal period thereafter. It is the responsibility of the permit holder to maintain NICET II certification or equivalent training and education as determined by the division as a condition of permit renewal after July 1, 2008.</div>

            </div>
            <div>633.334 Requirements for installation, inspection, and maintenance of fire protection systems.—
            <div>(1) The requirements for installation of fire protection systems are as follows:
            <div>(a) Contractors of fire protection systems shall be certified under s. 633.318.</div>
            <div>(b) Equipment shall be listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, such as Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., or Factory Mutual Laboratories, Inc., or shall comply with nationally accepted standards. The State Fire Marshal shall adopt by rule procedures for determining whether a laboratory is nationally recognized, taking into account the laboratory’s facilities, procedures, use of nationally recognized standards, and any other criteria reasonably calculated to reach an informed determination.</div>
            <div>(c) Equipment shall be installed in accordance with the applicable standards of the National Fire Protection Association and the manufacturer’s specifications.</div>
            <div>(d) Each piece of equipment supplied shall be guaranteed for a period of 1 year against defects in material or operations.</div>
            <div>(e) The contractor shall furnish the user with operating instructions for all equipment installed, together with a diagram of the final installation.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) Equipment shall be inspected, serviced, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance procedures and with applicable National Fire Protection Association standards. The inspection of fire protection systems shall be conducted by a certificate holder or holder of a permit issued by the division. The permit holder may perform inspections on fire protection systems only while employed by the certificate holder. This section does not prohibit the authority having jurisdiction or insurance company representatives from reviewing the system in accordance with acceptable oversight standards.</div>
            <div>(3) For contracts written after June 30, 2005, the contractor who installs the underground piping from the point of service is responsible for completing the installation to the aboveground connection flange, which by definition in this chapter is no more than 1 foot above the finished floor, before completing the Contractor’s Material and Test Certificate for Underground Piping document. Aboveground contractors may not complete the Contractor’s Material and Test Certificate for Underground Piping document for underground piping or portions thereof which have been installed by others.</div>
            <div>(4) The Contractor V may install the cross-connection backflow prevention device as defined in this chapter on new installations following the engineer of record’s direction on the type and size of the device. The retrofitting of a backflow device on an existing fire protection system will cause a reduction in available water pressure and probable system malfunction. The development of aboveground fire protection system hydraulic calculations is a task of the Contractor I and II, as defined in this chapter. Accordingly, a Contractor V is expressly prohibited from retrofitting cross-connection backflow prevention devices on an existing fire protection system, and only a Contractor I or Contractor II who is tasked to recalculate the system and take corrective actions to ensure that the system will function with the available water supply may retroactively install these backflow devices on existing fire protection systems.</div>

            <div>Note.—Former s. 633.539.</div>
            </div>
            <div>633.336 Contracting without certificate prohibited; violations; penalty.—
            <div>(1) It is unlawful for any organization or individual to engage in the business of layout, fabrication, installation, inspection, alteration, repair, or service of a fire protection system, other than a pre-engineered system, act in the capacity of a fire protection contractor, or advertise itself as being a fire protection contractor without having been duly certified and holding a valid and existing certificate, except as hereinafter provided. The holder of a certificate used to qualify an organization must be a full-time employee of the qualified organization or business. A certificate holder who is employed by more than one fire protection contractor during the same time is deemed not to be a full-time employee of either contractor. The State Fire Marshal shall revoke, for a period determined by the State Fire Marshal, the certificate of a certificate holder who allows the use of the certificate to qualify a company of which the certificate holder is not a full-time employee. A contractor who maintains more than one place of business must employ a certificate holder at each location. This subsection does not prohibit an employee acting on behalf of governmental entities from inspecting and enforcing fire safety codes, provided such employee is certified under s. 633.216.</div>
            <div>(2) A fire protection contractor certified under this chapter may not:
            <div>(a) Enter into a written or oral agreement to authorize, or otherwise knowingly allow, a contractor who is not certified under this chapter to engage in the business of, or act in the capacity of, a fire protection contractor.</div>
            <div>(b) Apply for or obtain a construction permit for fire protection work unless the fire protection contractor or the business organization qualified by the fire protection contractor has contracted to conduct the work specified in the application for the permit.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) The Legislature recognizes that special expertise is required for fire pump control panels and maintenance of electric and diesel pump drivers and that it is not economically feasible for all contractors to employ these experts full-time whose work may be limited. It is therefore deemed acceptable for a fire protection contractor licensed under this chapter to subcontract with companies providing advanced technical services for the installation, servicing, and maintenance of fire pump control panels and pump drivers. To ensure the integrity of the system and to protect the interests of the property owner, those providing technical support services for fire pump control panels and pump drivers must be under contract with a licensed fire protection contractor.</div>
            <div>(4) A person who violates any provision of this act or commits any of the acts constituting cause for disciplinary action as herein set forth commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.</div>

            <div>(7) The filing of a petition in bankruptcy, either voluntary or involuntary, or the making of a composition of creditors or the appointment of a receiver for the business of the certificate holder may be considered by the State Fire Marshal as just cause for suspension of a certificate.</div>

            <div>633.422 Firefighters; supplemental compensation.—
            <div>(1) QUALIFICATIONS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION.—The Legislature recognizes the need for supplemental compensation for firefighters who pursue higher educational opportunities that directly relate to the improvement of the health, safety, and welfare of firefighters and those who firefighters protect. The State Fire Marshal shall determine, and adopt by rule, the coursework or degrees that represent the best practices toward this goal in the field of firefighting.
            <div>(a) In addition to the compensation now paid by a fire service provider to any firefighter, every firefighter shall be paid supplemental compensation by the fire service provider when such firefighter is a full-time employee, as determined by the employing fire service provider, and has complied with one of the following criteria:
            <div>1. A firefighter who receives an associate degree from an accredited college, which degree is directly applicable to fire department duties, as outlined in policy guidelines adopted by rule by the division, shall be additionally compensated as outlined in paragraph (2)(a).</div>
            <div>2. A firefighter, regardless of whether or not she or he earned an associate degree earlier, who receives from an accredited college or university a bachelor’s degree, which bachelor’s degree is directly applicable to fire department duties, as outlined in policy guidelines adopted by rule by the division, shall receive compensation as outlined in paragraph (2)(b).</div>
            </div>
            <div>(b) If any question arises as to the eligibility of any firefighter to receive supplemental compensation as provided in this section, the question, together with all facts relating thereto, must be submitted to the division for determination, and the decision of the division with regard to determination of eligibility shall be final, subject to chapter 120.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(2) SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION.—Supplemental compensation shall be determined as follows:
            <div>(a) Fifty dollars shall be paid monthly to each firefighter who qualifies under subparagraph (1)(a)1.</div>
            <div>(b) One hundred and ten dollars shall be paid monthly to each firefighter who qualifies under subparagraph (1)(a)2.</div>
            </div>
            <div>(3) FUNDING.—
            <div>(a) The fire service provider is responsible for the correct payment of firefighters pursuant to this section. The division may review, in a post-audit capacity, any action taken by an agency in administering the educational incentive program. The fire service provider shall take appropriate action when a post-audit shows that an action taken by the fire service provider was in error.</div>
            <div>(b) Each fire service provider employing firefighters who are eligible for this compensation shall submit reports containing information relating to compensation paid as a result of this section to the division on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year.</div>
            <div>(c) There is appropriated from the Police and Firefighter’s Premium Tax Trust Fund to the Firefighters’ Supplemental Compensation Trust Fund, which is created under the Department of Revenue, all moneys which have not been distributed to municipalities and special fire control districts in accordance with s. 175.121 as a result of the limitation contained in s. 175.122 on the disbursement of revenues collected pursuant to chapter 175 or as a result of any municipality or special fire control district not having qualified in any given year, or portion thereof, for participation in the distribution of the revenues collected pursuant to chapter 175. The total required annual distribution from the Firefighters’ Supplemental Compensation Trust Fund shall equal the amount necessary to pay supplemental compensation as provided in this section, provided that:
            <div>1. Any deficit in the total required annual distribution shall be made up from accrued surplus funds existing in the Firefighters’ Supplemental Compensation Trust Fund on June 30, 1990, for as long as such funds last. If the accrued surplus is insufficient to cure the deficit in any given year, the proration of the appropriation among the counties, municipalities, and special fire service taxing districts shall equal the ratio of compensation paid in the prior year to county, municipal, and special fire service taxing district firefighters pursuant to this section. This ratio shall be provided annually to the Department of Revenue by the division.

            <div>(1) The division shall develop a means to identify individual firefighter employers with a high frequency of firefighter employee work-related injuries. The division shall conduct safety inspections of those firefighter employers so identified to ensure compliance with this part or the division’s rules and make recommendations based upon current safety and health practices and to assist such firefighter employers in reducing the number of work-related injuries. The division may not assess penalties as a result of such inspections. Copies of any report made as the result of such an inspection shall be provided to the firefighter employer and its insurer. Firefighter employers shall submit a plan for the correction of any noncompliance issues to the division for approval in accordance with division rule. The division shall promptly review the plan submitted and approve or disapprove the plan within 60 days, or such plan shall be deemed approved. Upon approval by the division, the plan shall be implemented by the firefighter employer. If the plan is not submitted, does not provide corrective actions for all deficiencies, is not complete, or is not implemented, the fire service provider shall be subject to s. 633.526.</div>

            <div>(b) Each firefighter employer of fewer than 20 firefighter employees with a high frequency or high severity of work-related injuries, as identified by the division, shall establish and administer a workplace safety committee or designate a workplace safety coordinator who shall establish and administer workplace safety activities in accordance with rules adopted under this section.</div>

            <div>4. Prescribing guidelines for the training of safety committee members.</div>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div>(4) The composition, selection, and function of workplace safety committees shall be a mandatory topic of negotiations with any certified collective bargaining agent for firefighter employers that operate under a collective bargaining agreement. Firefighter employers that operate under a collective bargaining agreement that contains provisions governing the formation and operation of workplace safety committees that meet or exceed the minimum requirements contained in this section, or firefighter employers who otherwise have existing workplace safety committees that meet or exceed the minimum requirements established by this section, are in compliance with this section.</div>
            <div>(5) Firefighter employees shall be compensated their regular hourly wage while engaged in workplace safety committee or workplace safety coordinator training, meetings, or other duties prescribed under this section.</div>
            <div>(6) If a firefighter employer fails to implement a corrective plan, the insurer or self-insurer’s fund that is providing coverage for the firefighter employer may cancel the contract for insurance with the firefighter employer. In the alternative, the insurer or fund may terminate any discount or deviation granted to the firefighter employer for the remainder of the term of the policy. If the contract is canceled or the discount or deviation is terminated, the insurer must make such reports as are required by law.</div>
