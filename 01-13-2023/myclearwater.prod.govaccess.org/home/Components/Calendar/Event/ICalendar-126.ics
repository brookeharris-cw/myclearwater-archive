The ARPA allocation must be committed or contractually encumbered to<br aria-hidden="true">projects and programs by the end of calendar year 2024. All monies must be spent by 2026 and any monies unspent at that time must be refunded to the<br aria-hidden="true">federal government.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">The following projects meet the criteria and are being recommended by Clearwater staff:<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Startup Funding for North Greenwood Community Redevelopment Agency<br aria-hidden="true">$5 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds will help the North Greenwood Community Redevelopment Agency start its redevelopment efforts. Because the Community Redevelopment Agency's future funding is predicated on increasing the taxable value of the properties within the area, staff believes an initial investment in the neighborhood is appropriate to jumpstart these efforts. A centerpiece of the area is the North Ward School which the city has acquired and is ready to redevelop. Many other efforts are currently being planned in this area which is generally defined as a roughly 1.31-square-mile area to the north and northeast of downtown.</p><p>Fiber Upgrades and Broadband Connectivity<br aria-hidden="true">$3.5 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds will be used to upgrade the city's traffic management infrastructure which will allow for better traffic management by using an Intelligent Traffic System that can be integrated with regional partner's systems. This will allow for better flow of traffic which will have positive benefits in the areas of local job creation, travel time to/from work, and sustainability. Additionally, the infrastructure upgrades create a more secure network infrastructure for the city to protect city assets and enhance provided services.</p><p>Affordable Housing<br aria-hidden="true">$3.3 million<br aria-hidden="true">Housing projects will include down payment assistance, rehabilitation and new construction of single-family and multi-family homes, and energy efficiency improvements such as installation of cool roofs and solar panels when practicable. These funds will be used to assist households with incomes between 80 and 120 percent Area Median Income. While this income bracket will be the primary target, worthwhile projects assisting households below 80 percent Area Mean Income will also be considered.</p><p>Street and Sidewalk Improvements<br aria-hidden="true">$2 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds will be used to expedite roadway, curb and sidewalk improvements in low-income communities. Approximately $1.8 million will be spent on milling/resurfacing roadways and approximately $320,000 will be spent on sidewalk and curb improvements. This $2 million will be in addition to the $5.2 to $5.7 million that is budgeted annually for street and sidewalk improvements.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Solar Panels for City Facilities<br aria-hidden="true">$2 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds would be used to kick off the city's solar installation program on city buildings. These investments will help reduce the costs related to energy<br aria-hidden="true">use, allowing for operational funds to be reallocated or tax rates reduced.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Pinellas Community Foundation<br aria-hidden="true">$1 million<br aria-hidden="true">Pinellas Community Foundation will solicit, evaluate and award up to $1,000,000 to a nonprofit organization that offers an innovative and impactful concept for affordable and attainable housing in the city of Clearwater. Awardee must be able to complete the project by September 30, 2026.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Non-Profit Cultural Affairs Funding<br aria-hidden="true">$1 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds are proposed as a grant-based program. Non-profit organizations in Clearwater that provide services within Clearwater will have an opportunity to<br aria-hidden="true">request funding for programs that focus on cultural affairs. These could include area markets, concert or theatre events, or other community social opportunities that are trying to be become financially feasible or who need financial assistance getting back to pre-pandemic levels of effectiveness.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Education - Grants or Partnerships<br aria-hidden="true">$1 million<br aria-hidden="true">These funds will be used to provide a grant or partnership opportunity with a non-profit or government entity for programs that focus on educational opportunities targeting students who have fallen behind academically due to the pandemic.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">State Street Park Improvements<br aria-hidden="true">$700,000<br aria-hidden="true">This project will provide for the development of State Street Park located on the southwest corner of State Street and North Betty Lane. This property was<br aria-hidden="true">purchased more than 30 years ago for the purpose of developing a neighborhood park. The present homeowner association has been very active in promoting this<br aria-hidden="true">park and desires to have additional park improvements. Development of the park would preserve the tree canopy and allow the park to remain in as much of its natural state as possible. Development could include improved open field play areas and the addition of a playground, nature/walking trails, fencing, water fountain, parking, signage and other park amenities. Invasive plant species would also be removed from the park.</p><p>Clearwater Main Library Info Hub<br aria-hidden="true">$625,000<br aria-hidden="true">This project would transform the first floor of the Main Library into a one-stop destination that supports and enhances citizen use of the new Coachman Park and downtown by relocating the library's most-used resources and services. To support this one-stop model, part of the reference and circulation staff would join to create an "information hub" on the first floor where patrons could get any technical or library support or information about activities in Coachman Park.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Reimburse the City for COVID Expenses<br aria-hidden="true">$2,358,893<br aria-hidden="true">The city expended $1,379,498 of General Fund operating budget on the Clearwater Back to Business Grant and Professional Services Program during fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the city expended $1,741,242 city-wide on premium pay and vacation accruals for essential employees during the pandemic, per the city's emergency deployment and compensation policy. These two expenditure categories total $3,120,700 and staff is recommending $2,358,893 of reimbursement.</p>
