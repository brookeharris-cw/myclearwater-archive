<div class='accordion-content' aria-expanded='false'><div class='inner-content'><h2>Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District</h2>
<p>In 1999 the City of Clearwater implemented a new planning tool known as the Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD). The purpose of this designation is to provide a means of ensuring that infill and redevelopment activities in existing, stable neighborhoods are consistent with the protection of the existing character of the neighborhood. The designation calls for the preparation of a special area plan for the neighborhood that includes goals and objectives as well as development standards that are necessary and appropriate to protect the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood. Once the plan is prepared and approved by the City Commission, the NCOD is identified on the City’s zoning atlas and in the Community Development Code. The Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Association is the first neighborhood group in the City to initiate this planning process and take advantage of the NCOD provisions.</p>
<h2>Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Planning Process</h2>
<p>Coachman Ridge is an established and stable neighborhood that has experienced increasing property values over the years. The Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association became interested in the NCOD due to the voluntary nature of the Association and the potential difficulty in the enforcement of neighborhood standards. The Association expressed concern that lack of compliance with deed restrictions would alter the established character of the neighborhood and possibly result in a decline in property values and neighborhood quality of life.</p>
<p>In August 2000 the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association distributed a letter to all properties within the neighborhood explaining the NCOD. The letter also included a petition asking property owners whether or not they wanted to initiate the NCOD process for Coachman Ridge. Residents overwhelmingly endorsed the petition with 190 homeowners out of a total of 255 owners voting “yes” to proceed. This represents seventy-four percent (74%) of the neighborhood compared to the sixty percent (60%) approval rate required by the Clearwater Community Development Code. Only ten (10) homeowners voted “no” and fifty-five (55) did not vote.</p>
<p>The Coachman Ridge neighborhood submitted an application for NCOD designation and the required petition to the City on October 25, 2000. At the January 16, 2001 meeting, the Clearwater City Commission held a public meeting and determined that Coachman Ridge met the criteria set forth in the Community Development Code. The Commission’s action authorized the neighborhood to proceed with the NCOD planning process. The Commission appointed the requisite study committee, which was comprised of ten (10) neighborhood residents.</p>
<p>The Coachman Ridge neighborhood, in conjunction with city staff, held a total of five public meetings between February 2001 and May 2001. At the first meeting, residents identified strengths and weaknesses associated with their neighborhood and prioritized the issues identified. At the second and third meetings, residents developed goals and objectives to enhance neighborhood strengths and minimize neighborhood weaknesses. The fourth meeting was dedicated to reviewing the neighborhood’s deed restrictions and identifying development standards that should be included in the Coachman Ridge NCOD overlay provisions. At the fifth meeting, the neighborhood reviewed the final plan and agreed to submit it to the City for approval. Throughout the neighborhood planning process the study committee met with City staff to guide the process, establish a format for meetings and provide direction in the development of the Plan.</p>
<h2>Neighborhood Plan Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Coachman Ridge neighborhood plan is to provide a framework for neighborhood enhancement and change. It will serve as an official document for Coachman Ridge and the City of Clearwater. It should be used to coordinate public and private initiatives, as well as to provide the basis for the implementation of development standards unique to the neighborhood.</p></div></div></div>

<div class='accordion-content' aria-expanded='false'><div class='inner-content'><h1>EXISTING CONDITIONS</h1>
<h2>Neighborhood Location and Character</h2>
<p>The Coachman Ridge neighborhood is approximately 159 acres in area and consists of 255 parcels. It is centrally located within the City of Clearwater. It is bounded by Old Coachman Road on the southwest, N.E. Coachman Road on the southeast, a Florida Power right-of-way on the east and Coachman Lake Estates to the north. Map 1 depicts the general location of this neighborhood and Map 2 illustrates the neighborhood planning area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Coachman Ridge neighborhood is surrounded by a variety of land uses. To the immediate north are single-family homes and to the immediate east is a Florida Power Corporation right-of-way occupied by transmission lines. To the east of this right-of-way is Wal-Mart and Cameron Lakes Apartments. To the southeast are two multi-family developments known as Coachman Crossing and Town Place Apartments. To the south of the neighborhood are the C.S.X. Railroad Lines, Northeast Coachman Park, and Coachman Ridge Park. There is a trail at Coachman Ridge Park that provides a connection west to the Long Center, which fronts on Belcher Road. There is also a fruit stand located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Old Coachman Road and N.E. Coachman Road and to the west are the Alcove Mobile Home Park and other single-family development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coachman Ridge was platted in three phases between 1983 and 1984. There is no vacant land within the neighborhood and all 255 lots are occupied with single-family dwellings. The majority of properties (242 parcels) are zoned Low Medium Density Residential and have a future land use designation of Residential Low, which allows 5 dwelling units per acre. The remaining thirteen (13) properties located in the most northwesterly portion of the subdivision are zoned Low Density Residential and have an underlying future land use category of Residential Suburban. This designation permits a&nbsp;density of 2.5 dwelling units per acre. Map 3 depicts the existing zoning of Coachman Ridge.<br>
<br>
Coachman Ridge is a deed-restricted community. It has a variety of architectural styles and the minimum home size is 1800 square feet in area. All homes have attached garages and many have three or four bedrooms and swimming pools. Mature landscaping and well maintained properties are found throughout the neighborhood. According to the Pinellas County Property Appraiser, property values average 12% above citywide property values. As of Fall 2000, less than 10% of the properties within Coachman Ridge had outstanding code violations. The most commonly found violations involved excessive watering, fences, pool maintenance, unlicensed vehicles, overgrown weeds and vehicles parked over sidewalks.<br>
<br>
There are three (3) entrances into Coachman Ridge. One is located off of N.E. Coachman Road at El Tair Trail. The other two entrances are along Old Coachman Road at Farrier Trail and at Wetherington Road. There are landscaped medians at the entrances on El Tair Trail and Farrier Trail and all three entrances have neighborhood signage. The Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association maintains these improvements.<br>
<br>
The majority of rights-of-way in Coachman Ridge are fifty (50) feet in width with wider areas located at the neighborhood entrances at El Tair Trail and Farrier Trail. El Tair Trail is the only right-of-way that is sixty (60) feet in width. Street pavements are typically twenty-two (22) to twenty-four (24) feet in width. There is a continuous sidewalk system within Coachman Ridge, as well as curbs. Standard Florida Power lighting is located along the streets and all utilities are underground with the exception of&nbsp;above ground utility boxes. Several retention ponds are located within Coachman Ridge, all of which are on private property, and a portion of Channel F of Alligator Creek is located within the northwestern portion of the neighborhood. All infrastructure is in average to good condition, with the exception of several streets that need to be resurfaced.</p>
<h2>Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association</h2>
<p>The Coachman Ridge neighborhood was developed with deed restrictions, however, no neighborhood association was created. In the early years of the subdivision, residents wanted to find a way to help neighbors get acquainted with one another. In 1985 residents formed a voluntary neighborhood association that was incorporated in 1986. The purpose of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Association as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation is “for the betterment of the neighborhood and the furtherance of community spirit, and to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of those certain tracts of land known as Coachman Ridge.” The Association has all of the powers typically held by neighborhood associations except that it is not empowered to sue any homeowner residing in the neighborhood.<br>
<br>
Over the years the Association has sponsored many social activities ranging from holiday gatherings, garage sales, day trips and monthly meetings. At present the Association holds an annual neighborhood garage sale, association meetings and an annual membership drive. It has a welcome committee that greets all new residents and invites them to join the Association. It also produces a neighborhood directory and publishes a newsletter four – six times a year. The voluntary Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association has been very successful at getting property owners to join and enjoys a membership rate of approximately eighty percent (80%) of the total properties.</p>
<h2>Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch</h2>
<p>The Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch was formed in 1984 and is a component of the Homeowners Association. The program, which is sponsored by the Clearwater Police Department, is designed to enhance neighborhood security, to<br>
<br>
heighten the community’s power of observation and to encourage mutual assistance and concern among neighbors. The Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch has sixteen (16) block captains, a neighborhood watch coordinator, as well as a back-up coordinator.</p>
<h3>Projects Proposed in the Neighborhood Vicinity</h3>
<h4>Florida Power Trail</h4>
<p>In 1996 the Bicycle Advisory Committee of the Metropolitan Planning Organization initiated a series of discussions regarding the possibility of a Florida Power Corridor Trail. Over the next several years, work proceeded on this idea and in 1999 Florida Power and the Pinellas County Board of Commissioners agreed to the development and construction of the Florida Power Trail within existing Florida Power rights-of-way. This 20.6-mile corridor will begin at the intersection of Tampa Road and McMullen-Booth Road and proceed west and then south and ultimately end at the Weedon Island Preserve near I-275 and Gandy Boulevard. The trail will provide bicycle and pedestrian opportunities in a portion of the County that is not currently served by the County’s trail system. The facility will consist of a twenty-five (25) foot easement area, which will support a fifteen (15) foot wide paved trail with five (5) foot wide buffers on each side. Amenities such as benches, water fountains, landscaping and informational signage will be located along the trail within buffer areas.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4>Community Sports Complex</h4>
<p>Construction of a new community sports complex, which will be used as the Philadelphia Phillies Major League Spring Training facility and home of the Clearwater Phillies Minor League team, is scheduled to begin in October 2001 at the northwest corner of Drew Street and Old Coachman Road. The facility will be an open air, natural grass ballpark meeting first class Major League Baseball spring training standards. There will be approximately 7,000 fixed seats and an outfield berm seating area for close to 1,000 fans. The ballpark will also<br>
<br>
accommodate all clubhouse facilities, batting tunnel, team office space and other elements typically found at a stadium. The site will also support one full size lighted practice field, one practice infield and parking for 1,175 vehicles. Construction is projected to be complete by January 2003.</p>
<h1>NEIGHBORHOOD STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES</h1>
<p>At the first public neighborhood meeting held by the study committee on March 22, 2001, participants divided up into three groups and brainstormed about the strengths and weaknesses of Coachman Ridge. Each group presented their list of strengths and weaknesses to the entire group and then each participant was asked to prioritize the issues by identifying the three most important strengths and three most important weaknesses. Coachman Ridge residents identified the following issues as the neighborhoods’ priority strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h2>Coachman Ridge Strengths</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Location</strong>- Coachman Ridge residents ranked neighborhood location as the most important strength. The neighborhood is centrally located near US 19, which serves as the primary north-south transportation route in Pinellas County. Coachman Ridge is in close proximity to places of work, worship, schools, shopping, parks and trails, which makes its location attractive to potential residents. It is also minutes from Clearwater Beach, the St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Character</strong>- Neighborhood character was identified as a significant neighborhood strength. Coachman Ridge residents place a high value on the variety of architectural styles found in the neighborhood and the lot and house sizes required by the deed restrictions. Well-maintained property and mature landscaping are viewed as defining characteristics of Coachman Ridge, as well as underground utilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;- Quality infrastructure is regarded as another important neighborhood strength. Residents like the loop and curvilinear streets that keep traffic slow and prevent neighborhood streets from being used as cut-through streets. The construction of the Stag Run Boulevard cul-de-sac was identified as the most positive aspect of the neighborhood’s infrastructure. Stag Run Boulevard was a through street that provided an alternative traffic route from U.S. 19 to Old Coachman Road. Over the years the City received complaints about people parking along the eastern portion of the roadway, speeding and cut-through traffic. The issue came to the forefront when plans emerged for the construction of the Wal-Mart. During the site plan review process Wal-Mart agreed to construct the cul-de-sac as part of its development and it was completed in 1994. Properly functioning drainage is also regarded as an important neighborhood feature, as well as the continuous sidewalk system.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Security/Safety</strong><strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Residents attending the brainstorming session believe Coachman Ridge is a very quiet and safe neighborhood, and feel secure living in the neighborhood. Residents noted that they experienced very quick response times from the Clearwater Police Department and 911. Residents are also supportive of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch program, which they believe is an asset to the neighborhood.</li>
    <li><strong>Property Values</strong>&nbsp;- Property values in Coachman Ridge have been steadily increasing over the years. As stated in the existing conditions section of the Plan, Coachman Ridge property values average 12% above citywide property values. Increasing property values are very important to Coachman Ridge property owners. They believe that all of the identified priority strengths contribute to neighborhood stability and the above average property values found in the neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;Coachman Ridge Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Possible Impacts of Community Sports Complex - Coachman Ridge residents are concerned about the possible impacts of the new community sports complex. Of particular concern is the ability of Old Coachman Road and N.E. Coachman Road to accommodate additional traffic generated by complex events. Currently, during peak travel times, ingress and egress from Coachman Ridge is difficult. Residents fear that increased traffic, as a result of complex events, will create more congestion and have a negative impact on their quality of life. Residents are also apprehensive about other potential impacts such as increased noise, crime and litter. Lastly, Coachman Ridge is concerned about the types of events, other than baseball, that will occur in the complex.</li>
    <li>Neighborhood Perimeter - The perimeter of Coachman Ridge received an extensive amount of discussion, as well as consensus. The lack of a uniform wall around the neighborhood is an issue which neighbors agree needs to be addressed. Many residents believe that some of the existing wooden fences are old, unattractive and in disrepair. They are concerned about the effect piecemeal fence replacement will have on neighborhood appearance and image.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>The proposed construction of the Florida Power Trail, which will be on the eastern edge of the neighborhood, troubles some residents. There is fear that the trail may bring litter and crime into the neighborhood because there will be a new, less visible means of access into Coachman Ridge.<br>
        <br>
        Residents believe the increased activity that the new community sports complex and Florida Power Trail will bring to the surrounding neighborhood intensifies the need for perimeter fencing that will increase safety and provide noise abatement.<br>
        <br>
        Another perimeter issue identified is the lack of sidewalks on the north side of N.E. Coachman Road and on the east side of Old Coachman Road adjacent to the Coachman Ridge neighborhood. Due to the significant amount of traffic on these roadways, the neighborhood has been working with the Florida Department of Transportation to get sidewalks constructed. Residents view the lack of sidewalks in these rights-of-way as an important perimeter safety issue that needs to be resolved.<br>
        <br>
        Three other perimeter issues were identified as weaknesses. One is overgrown vegetation surrounding the neighborhood and in particular in the Florida Power right-of-way. Another is the lack of maintenance and litter control on N.E. Coachman and Old Coachman Roads. The other issue is noise associated with US 19, airplanes, perimeter traffic and Wal-Mart.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Traffic and Parking&nbsp;</strong>- The volume of traffic on Old Coachman Road and N.E. Coachman Road has become a major concern of Coachman Ridge residents. Since there are no turning lanes on either of these streets, traffic backs up during peak periods when cars are trying to make left turns. This congestion blocks neighborhood entrances, making it difficult to get in and out of the neighborhood. This problem is most evident at the intersection of El Tair Trail and N.E. Coachman Road and was documented in the traffic study conducted for the new community sports complex. Speeding on N.E. Coachman Road was another problem identified by Coachman Ridge residents.
    <ul>
        <li>Several issues related to parking were identified as neighborhood weaknesses. Residents believe that when cars are parked on both sides of the street directly across from one another, it is difficult for cars to drive through. Another&nbsp;parking issue discussed is when cars park in such a manner as to block sidewalks. When this occurs, pedestrians cannot use the sidewalk and in many instances are forced to use the street.<br>
        <br>
        Another parking issue discussed is the parking of vehicles outside of garages, although there is sensitivity to the fact that today’s vehicles do not always fit inside garages or a family may have more vehicles than the garage can accommodate. There was overwhelming consensus that boats, trailers, recreational vehicles and commercial vehicles continue to be parked inside garages as required by the deed restrictions. The only other parking issue noted was the late night parking that occasionally occurs at the Stag Run Boulevard cul-de-sac.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Property Maintenance</strong>&nbsp;- Many properties are well maintained in the Coachman Ridge neighborhood; however, poor property maintenance evident in some homes is viewed as a significant weakness. Residents believe that unkempt properties have a negative impact on neighborhood appearance and value. Residents discussed specific areas of maintenance that cause particular concern. This discussion centered on roofs with mildew, rust stains on homes and sidewalks, fence maintenance and yard maintenance i.e. overgrown and dead landscaping and fruit tree maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Voluntary Homeowners Association</strong>&nbsp;- Residents ranked having a voluntary homeowners association as a weakness. Because the association is not mandatory, the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association cannot rely on mandatory dues. This is a problem because the Association has been responsible for planting and maintaining landscaping at the neighborhood&nbsp;entrances, publishing a neighborhood directory and newsletter, etc. Every year the Association must have a membership drive to secure funds to continue its activities. Another weakness of a voluntary association pointed out by some residents is its lack of authority compared to the board of a mandatory association especially when enforcing deed restrictions. The voluntary Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association does enforce deed restrictions, however, strict enforcement can only occur if neighbors litigate.</li>
    <li>Lack of Reclaimed Water - Since quality landscaping and lawn maintenance is an important characteristic of Coachman Ridge, the inability of residents to get reclaimed water is an issue. Having to rely on potable water for lawn maintenance is expensive and is limiting due to the restriction on the number of days one can water. Residents believe as the drought continues or if water costs rise, they will not be able to maintain their property to meet neighborhood standards.&nbsp;</li>

<div class='accordion-item' role='button' id='NeighborhoodStrengthsandWeaknesses' data-index='3'><div class='accordion-heading' tabindex='0'><div class='title'>Neighborhood Strengths and Weaknesses</div><div class='icon'><i class='arrow right' role='presentation'></i></div></div>
<div class='accordion-content' aria-expanded='false'><div class='inner-content'><p>At the first public neighborhood meeting held by the study committee on March 22, 2001, participants divided up into three groups and brainstormed about the strengths and weaknesses of Coachman Ridge. Each group presented their list of strengths and weaknesses to the entire group and then each participant was asked to prioritize the issues by identifying the three most important strengths and three most important weaknesses. Coachman Ridge residents identified the following issues as the neighborhoods’ priority strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<h2>Coachman Ridge Strengths</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Location</strong>- Coachman Ridge residents ranked neighborhood location as the most important strength. The neighborhood is centrally located near US 19, which serves as the primary north-south transportation route in Pinellas County. Coachman Ridge is in close proximity to places of work, worship, schools, shopping, parks and trails, which makes its location attractive to potential residents. It is also minutes from Clearwater Beach, the St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Character</strong>- Neighborhood character was identified as a significant neighborhood strength. Coachman Ridge residents place a high value on the variety of architectural styles found in the neighborhood and the lot and house sizes required by the deed restrictions. Well-maintained property and mature landscaping are viewed as defining characteristics of Coachman Ridge, as well as underground utilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;- Quality infrastructure is regarded as another important neighborhood strength. Residents like the loop and curvilinear streets that keep traffic slow and prevent neighborhood streets from being used as cut-through streets. The construction of the Stag Run Boulevard cul-de-sac was identified as the most positive aspect of the neighborhood’s infrastructure. Stag Run Boulevard was a through street that provided an alternative traffic route from U.S. 19 to Old Coachman Road. Over the years the City received complaints about people parking along the eastern portion of the roadway, speeding and cut-through traffic. The issue came to the forefront when plans emerged for the construction of the Wal-Mart. During the site plan review process Wal-Mart agreed to construct the cul-de-sac as part of its development and it was completed in 1994. Properly functioning drainage is also regarded as an important neighborhood feature, as well as the continuous sidewalk system.</li>
    <li><strong>Neighborhood Security/Safety</strong><strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Residents attending the brainstorming session believe Coachman Ridge is a very quiet and safe neighborhood, and feel secure living in the neighborhood. Residents noted that they experienced very quick response times from the Clearwater Police Department and 911. Residents are also supportive of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch program, which they believe is an asset to the neighborhood.</li>
    <li><strong>Property Values</strong>&nbsp;- Property values in Coachman Ridge have been steadily increasing over the years. As stated in the existing conditions section of the Plan, Coachman Ridge property values average 12% above citywide property values. Increasing property values are very important to Coachman Ridge property owners. They believe that all of the identified priority strengths contribute to neighborhood stability and the above average property values found in the neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;Coachman Ridge Weaknesses</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Possible Impacts of Community Sports Complex - Coachman Ridge residents are concerned about the possible impacts of the new community sports complex. Of particular concern is the ability of Old Coachman Road and N.E. Coachman Road to accommodate additional traffic generated by complex events. Currently, during peak travel times, ingress and egress from Coachman Ridge is difficult. Residents fear that increased traffic, as a result of complex events, will create more congestion and have a negative impact on their quality of life. Residents are also apprehensive about other potential impacts such as increased noise, crime and litter. Lastly, Coachman Ridge is concerned about the types of events, other than baseball, that will occur in the complex.</li>
    <li>Neighborhood Perimeter - The perimeter of Coachman Ridge received an extensive amount of discussion, as well as consensus. The lack of a uniform wall around the neighborhood is an issue which neighbors agree needs to be addressed. Many residents believe that some of the existing wooden fences are old, unattractive and in disrepair. They are concerned about the effect piecemeal fence replacement will have on neighborhood appearance and image.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>The proposed construction of the Florida Power Trail, which will be on the eastern edge of the neighborhood, troubles some residents. There is fear that the trail may bring litter and crime into the neighborhood because there will be a new, less visible means of access into Coachman Ridge.<br>
        <br>
        Residents believe the increased activity that the new community sports complex and Florida Power Trail will bring to the surrounding neighborhood intensifies the need for perimeter fencing that will increase safety and provide noise abatement.<br>
        <br>
        Another perimeter issue identified is the lack of sidewalks on the north side of N.E. Coachman Road and on the east side of Old Coachman Road adjacent to the Coachman Ridge neighborhood. Due to the significant amount of traffic on these roadways, the neighborhood has been working with the Florida Department of Transportation to get sidewalks constructed. Residents view the lack of sidewalks in these rights-of-way as an important perimeter safety issue that needs to be resolved.<br>
        <br>
        Three other perimeter issues were identified as weaknesses. One is overgrown vegetation surrounding the neighborhood and in particular in the Florida Power right-of-way. Another is the lack of maintenance and litter control on N.E. Coachman and Old Coachman Roads. The other issue is noise associated with US 19, airplanes, perimeter traffic and Wal-Mart.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Traffic and Parking&nbsp;</strong>- The volume of traffic on Old Coachman Road and N.E. Coachman Road has become a major concern of Coachman Ridge residents. Since there are no turning lanes on either of these streets, traffic backs up during peak periods when cars are trying to make left turns. This congestion blocks neighborhood entrances, making it difficult to get in and out of the neighborhood. This problem is most evident at the intersection of El Tair Trail and N.E. Coachman Road and was documented in the traffic study conducted for the new community sports complex. Speeding on N.E. Coachman Road was another problem identified by Coachman Ridge residents.
    <ul>
        <li>Several issues related to parking were identified as neighborhood weaknesses. Residents believe that when cars are parked on both sides of the street directly across from one another, it is difficult for cars to drive through. Another&nbsp;parking issue discussed is when cars park in such a manner as to block sidewalks. When this occurs, pedestrians cannot use the sidewalk and in many instances are forced to use the street.<br>
        <br>
        Another parking issue discussed is the parking of vehicles outside of garages, although there is sensitivity to the fact that today’s vehicles do not always fit inside garages or a family may have more vehicles than the garage can accommodate. There was overwhelming consensus that boats, trailers, recreational vehicles and commercial vehicles continue to be parked inside garages as required by the deed restrictions.

This discussion centered on roofs with mildew, rust stains on homes and sidewalks, fence maintenance and yard maintenance i.e. overgrown and dead landscaping and fruit tree maintenance.</li>
    <li><strong>Voluntary Homeowners Association</strong>&nbsp;- Residents ranked having a voluntary homeowners association as a weakness. Because the association is not mandatory, the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association cannot rely on mandatory dues. This is a problem because the Association has been responsible for planting and maintaining landscaping at the neighborhood&nbsp;entrances, publishing a neighborhood directory and newsletter, etc. Every year the Association must have a membership drive to secure funds to continue its activities. Another weakness of a voluntary association pointed out by some residents is its lack of authority compared to the board of a mandatory association especially when enforcing deed restrictions. The voluntary Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association does enforce deed restrictions, however, strict enforcement can only occur if neighbors litigate.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Neighborhood Actions</h2>
<h3>Enforcement of Overlay Standards</h3>
<p>Pursuant to Section 4-608 of the Clearwater Community Development Code, neighborhoods participating in the NCOD must become a partner with the City to implement the NCOD provisions. Neighborhoods are required to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Educate neighborhood property owners of NCOD requirements at least two times a year through neighborhood association meetings and mailings or any other methods approved by the Community Development Coordinator; and</li>
    <li>Provide the initial means of enforcement for any violation of the requirements of the overlay district. If compliance cannot be gained by the neighborhood, the City shall commence code enforcement efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to meet the education requirement, the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association will provide information regarding the NCOD at the annual homeowners association meeting and in at least one issue of the Association newsletter. Upon initial adoption of the Plan, one copy of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Plan will be provided to each household in the neighborhood and to new owners as properties transfer.</p>
<p>The Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association shall also be responsible for providing the initial means of enforcement of the development standards created by the NCOD. In the event a violation of the Coachman Ridge NCOD development standards occurs, the Homeowners Association shall use the following procedures to gain compliance. Even though individual situations may differ and require some deviations, the usual procedures shall be as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a violation is identified, a correction notice i.e. door hanger, post card or letter shall be left on the property identifying the violation and noting that a re-inspection will be conducted in ten (10) days to determine if compliance has been achieved;</li>
    <li>If in that time period compliance is not achieved, a code violation letter will be issued giving a specific amount of time to comply, but in no case more than ten (10) days; and</li>
    <li>If compliance is not gained after the time period allotted in the code violation letter, the violation shall be reported to the City of Clearwater Community Response Team for immediate action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The development standards implemented in the Coachman Ridge NCOD shall be in effect as long as the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association provides the required neighborhood education and enforcement. In the event the Association does not perform its required function, a rezoning would be initiated by the City to eliminate the Coachman Ridge Overlay District.</p>
<p>If the neighborhood wants to make amendments to the overlay requirements or if the neighborhood decides it no longer wants to participate in the NCOD, the City will process a request to amend or remove the Coachman Ridge NCOD by a petition of owners of 60% of the real property within the NCOD. In the event the provisions of the Coachman Ridge Overlay District results in sustained extraordinary increases in the level of service provided by the City of Clearwater, the City and the neighborhood will need to evaluate the provisions of the NCOD and determine the most appropriate means of providing this increased level of service or if the service should be continued.</p>
<h4>Implementation of Other Plan Objectives</h4>
<p>In addition to education and enforcement, the Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association shall pursue activities to meet the goals and objectives established in this Plan. The following actions should address many of the objectives requiring neighborhood action.</p>
<p>The Coachman Ridge Homeowners Association shall create neighborhood liaisons with the public agencies responsible for maintaining parks, utilities, infrastructure and overall neighborhood quality of life.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Appoint a resident to serve as the neighborhood liaison with the City of Clearwater to provide accurate communication to the Coachman Ridge neighborhood on City programs and projects, including but not limited to, parks and recreation, community sports complex, sidewalk maintenance, code enforcement, “Adopt a Street” program, and neighborhood services.</li>
    <li>Work with Florida Power and Pinellas County to maintain accurate information on the status of the Florida Power Trail project.</li>
    <li>Appoint a resident to serve as the neighborhood liaison with the utility, cable and telephone companies so that the neighborhood is aware of any work to be done in the Coachman Ridge neighborhood, as well as the actual companies that will perform the work. The liaison should also work with these companies to minimize any inconveniences construction may cause to the neighborhood.</li>
    <li>Appoint a resident to work with public and private agencies on traffic issues relating to Old Coachman Road and N. E. Coachman Road.</li>
    <li>Create and maintain ongoing neighborhood education programs to provide information to residents on issues such as general property maintenance, landscaping, fruit tree maintenance, retention pond maintenance, and xeriscaping. Speakers from the City of Clearwater and Pinellas County Cooperative Extension Services could provide residents with information on these types of topics.</li>
    <li>Continue to increase neighborhood involvement in the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Watch.</li>
    <li>Members of the Neighborhood Watch should work with the Clearwater Police Department and Neighborhood Services to develop ways to improve communication between block captains and residents.</li>
    <li>Participate in annual Citywide Crime Watch event sponsored by the Clearwater Police Department.</li>

<div class='accordion-content' aria-expanded='false'><div class='inner-content'>The development of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Plan is evidence of the neighborhood’s desire to maintain existing neighborhood standards and quality of life. This special area plan provides the basis for the implementation of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District in the Clearwater Community Development Code. The development regulations set forth in this document will protect the existing neighborhood character and should ensure that redevelopment is consistent with that character. Many issues identified in the Plan require neighborhood involvement and action and cannot be addressed through development regulations; therefore, neighborhood organization and participation is key to the implementation of the Coachman Ridge Neighborhood Plan.</div></div></div>
