<p>CLEARWATER, Fla. &#8212; The Clearwater Memorial Causeway connects downtown Clearwater to Clearwater Beach and during the next couple of months, it&#8217;s going to be jammed packed with cars while people head to one of America&#8217;s best beaches for spring break.</p>
<p>Once you finally make it to the island, the search for parking begins.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.myclearwater.com/Home/Components/News/News/1020/266?backlist=%2FHome%2FComponents%2FCalendar%2FEvent%2F2355%2F">City of Clearwater is offering a free park and ride service</a> from now through April 29 to help fight the traffic and parking issues. But there is another way to avoid the traffic, and it involves heading out on the water.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.clearwaterferry.com/">Clearwater Ferry</a> makes stops in Downtown Clearwater, Clearwater Beach Marina, North Beach and Island Estates.</p>

<p>Beachgoers can Park and Ride for Free to Clearwater Beach through April 29</p>
<p>The city of Clearwater and the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority are offering free parking and rides to the beach from now until April 29.</p>
<p>The promotion, which started Feb. 19, runs through Sunday, April 29. The service will pick-up at two designated parking lots in downtown Clearwater every fifteen minutes and drop-off riders at PSTA’s new Clearwater Beach Transit Center just east of the roundabout. Riders who board at either the Harborview Center parking lot at 300 Cleveland St. or at the City Hall parking lot at 112 S. Osceola Ave. will receive a free PSTA Day Pass good for unlimited usage on any route in their system for the remainder of that day.</p>
<p>“The city of Clearwater is pleased to partner with PSTA to help alleviate some traffic congestion to Clearwater Beach,” said Clearwater Mayor George Cretekos. “This Park &amp; Ride promotion will give beachgoers and employees an alternative mode of transportation which will be beneficial because parking, while plentiful, is limited during the spring.”</p>
<p>This is the second year PSTA and the city have partnered to provide enhanced public transportation services as an alternative to driving and parking on the beach.</p>
<p>“We’ve had great success with this promotion in the past, and many of our residents and international visitors have come to rely on the convenience of this Park &amp; Ride service during Spring Break,” said PSTA Chief Executive Officer Brad Miller. “The amount of community support that we have received from the City of Clearwater has been invaluable to the success of this promotion.”</p>
